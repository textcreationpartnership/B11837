            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And this Churche not to be of one time only but of all tymes &amp; ages, as Adam with Eue hys wife, his ſun Abel &amp; his familie was the church, Noah with his familie was the churche. Melchizedec with his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie was the Churche, Abraham alſo with his familie. Likewyſe Iſaac, Iacob, Dauid, the Prophetes and Apoſtles with theyr Auditours that beleued in the Goſpell of Chriſt were the churche, and where ſoeuer at this daye the Goſpel of Chriſt is receyued and beleued there is alſo the church of Chriſt which by a figuratiue ſpeache may be aptly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Ship of Peter or Arcke of Noe. Now let vs conſider the ſtate of the churche vnder Adam, wherof the chiefeſt member was righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Abel, but him doth his brother Cain perſecute for Religion and ſlayeth hym And this was the beginning of the tempeſt that aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the Ship of Peter, the beginning I meane, of the perſecution of the church which ſhal laſt to the worldes ende. Lykewyſe dyd the churche vnder Abraham ſuffer perſecution by Iſmaell, vnder Iſaac by Eſau, vnder Moſes of Pharao, vnder Eli the high Prieſt the Arke of the Lorde was taken by the Philiſtines, and then it was thought that the church ſhulde haue quyte periſhed vnder Achab and wicked Iezabel, the Churche was not onlye afflicted and ſore oppreſſed, but alſo in a maner extinguiſhed where the Prophet Helias complayned that he was lefte alone. Vnder Ieremie, the Citie of Ieruſalem was deſtroyed of the Babylonians, and the churche was not lyke then to periſh, but rather vtterly loſt already, when Chriſt the head of the Churche, was crutified, it was iudged that the churche had then ben cleane deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We had thought (ſay they) that he ſhoulde haue redemed Iſraell, what tyme king Pharao with his hoſt had incloſed the Iſraelites, that is to witte, the churche betwene the mountaines and the Red Sea, it was lyke that the churche ſhulde haue periſhed, but Moſes prayed &amp; the Lorde miraculouſly deliuered them: Againe, the churche ſemed to be in extreme daunger when Sennacherib ſpoyled the kyngdome of Iuda, and ment to deſtroy Ieruſalem, but througe the prayer of Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias the Kyng, God ſent his Angell and diſtroyed the hoſt of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians. The church ſemed to tende vnto ruine, when Herod had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Iames with the ſweard, and minded alſo Peter, but the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contynewyng in prayer, the Lorde ſent his Angel to deliuer Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And to be ſhort in thoſe ten greuous perſecutions which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediatly after the Apoſtles time the church many times ſemed
<pb facs="tcp:154393:4"/> brought vnto vtter decay, but alwayes when God ſaw it good it was reuiued, and as it were refreſhed agayne. What ſhuld I recite the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the churche in the time of Athanaſius wherin the Arrian Biſhoppes ſo preuayled that the Emperour and his whole Armye ſo perſecuted Athanaſius, that the good Biſhop was fayne to lye hyd in an holle, where he ſaw no ſunne by the ſpace of ſixe yeares. And who wold then haue thought that euer the trew churche of Chriſt ſhulde haue flouriſhed agayne? I nede not here to reherſe the cruell perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the church vnder the Romiſh antichriſt which neuertheleſſe haue ben and be yet ſtyll moſt tyranicall and blouddye. For that the ſame ſhall in this preſent worke more clerely appere, then that I nede to make any diſcourſe therof, only I wolde ſhewe, briefely as dothe my Author, at large, that Chriſtes trewe churche, is alwayes ſubiect to perſecutions. To thintent therfore to paſſe ouer many thynges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, and to come nerer our fathers memorye, in the tyme of the Emperoure Sigiſmunde, there was holden a counſell at Conſtaunce, wherein, the Biſhops ſo conſpired, to extinguiſh Chriſtes veritie, that contrary to thauncient libertie of a free and general Counſel, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Emperours ſaufconduit, they not only burned there Iohn Huſſe and Hierome of Prage, profeſſours of Chryſtes Goſpell, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed alſo, that the bones of Iohn Wickleffe, ſumtime Perſon of Lut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terworth, here in Englande: ſhuld be taken vp and brent. whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall crueltie, of raging againſt dead men, our popiſhe prelacie of late dayes, rightly Imitatynge, as the children of one father, that was a murtherer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, practyſed lyke tyranny with the bones of Martin Bucer and Paulus Fagius at Cambridge. Such raging ſurges of late dayes did beate againſt the Ship of Peter. Bleſſed be the Lorde Ieſus, that hath ſent vs a goodly caulme, accordyng to the ſaying of the Prophet Dauid. The Iuſte ſhall ſuffer muche tribulotion, but the Lorde delyuereth them out of all. And this is verely the argument &amp; ſum of this boke, that Chryſtes churche ſhall ſuffer greuous perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſhall neuer be left deſtitute. For where the dragon fighteth on the ſand, the Lambe Chryſt like a conquerour, ſtandeth on Mount Sion, right hable to ſuccour all his, to the great comfort and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his choſen, whiche of neceſſitie, muſte ſuffer with Chryſt, yf with him, we will be glorifyed: And as Chriſt him ſelfe, when he was rayled vpon, gaue no euil words again. So is the true church of Chriſt knowen in this, that it ſuffereth perſecution, and doeth not perſecute agayne. Wherfore lyke as wiſe kinge Salomon iudged her, to be the true mother of the childe, which had ſuche compaſſion on it, that ſhe had rather forgo the whole, then haue it diuided and diſmembred, &amp; the other to be the harlot, that had ouerlayne her childe whiche had alſo conſented to the death of thother: Right ſo maye we diſcerne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently
<pb facs="tcp:154393:5"/> the whoriſh churche of Antichriſt by her bluddy perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the true churche and ſpouſe of Chryſt, the one with ſweard and fyre ſeketh alwayes to quenche the treuth, the other through the ſperite of lenitie, to winne men to the ſame, the one by compulſion and violent oppreſſion, thother by perſwaſion: and meke interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the one by the ſworde, the other by the worde, the one goeth aboute to peruert and depraue, the other ſeketh all meanes, to conuerte and ſaue. But leſt I ſhulde excede here the iuſte meaſure of an Epiſtle, and through prolexitie, be to your honour tediouſe, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe ſayeth) diſcerne a Lion by his clawes. I will breake of the thred of my diſcourſe, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that the matter is ſo ample &amp; large, that it wold require an other worke, wherin it is harder to fynde an ende, then it was a beginning, contented by theſe fewe examples of ſondry tymes, to haue ſignified not to your Lordſhip, which knowe them much better then I: And haue red this preſent work in Latin as you do all others right diligently. But through your ientil patience, to the plaine Engliſh Reader, that the true church of Chryſt hath ben in all ages perſecuted, and that this preſent worke, written vpon the Reuelation of S. Iohn, &amp; into an hundred Sermons digeſted, declareth no leſſe; and is as it were an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of the troubles and perſecutions of the Churche, eſpecially from the Apoſtles tyme, vntill the laſt day, wherin Chryſt, the head of the ſame ſhall come a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudge, to condemn Antichriſt, and all Antichriſtian hipocrites &amp; bluddy perſecutours: But to receyue his electe people and to crowne them with glory: And ſhall deliuer vp his kingdome, to his Father, &amp; God ſhall be all in all. Which worke vnderſtanding right well, that it ſhuld to your honour be acceptable. I dedicate and conſecrate to your name, as you beſt haue deſerued.

I will ſpeake of ether briefly, Collectyng thoſe thinges only, which ſeme to be more profitable and more neceſſary.<note place="margin">Iohn .xvi.</note> The Lorde had ſayd in the Goſpell, how he wold aſcende into heauen, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence wold ſend to his Apoſtles the holy Goſt, the comforter, which ſhulde leade them into all truth, and ſhew them the thinges that ar to come. And that which he ſayd he wolde do in wordes, the ſame verely hath he alſo perfourmed in dede aboundantly. The holy Goſt beyng ſent to his Apoſtles, which induced them into all truthe, and opened to them the thinges that were to come, eſpecially to the Apoſtle and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſt. S. Iohn, who receiued this Reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, exibited to him of Chriſt, from the ryght hand of the Father, by the miſtery of an Au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gel, in the holy Goſt, who alſo by Chryſte his commaundement, committed the ſame to wryting. The ſumme and ende of the which wryting is this:<note place="margin">The ſumme &amp; ende of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalipſe.</note> That Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, wil neuer fayle hys churche in earth, but will gouerne it with his ſpirite and worde, through theccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call miniſtery. But that the church it ſelf, whileſt it remaineth in this worlde ſhall ſuffer many thinges, and that for Chryſt and the truthe
<pb facs="tcp:154393:7"/> of his Goſpell profeſſed. And it openeth al and ſingular euils in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the church ſhal ſuffer, ſhewing how it muſt be exerciſed with common Calamities, as warre, plage famyne and ſuche other lyke, What it ſhall priuately ſuffer of the falſe bretherne through hereſies, ſchiſmes and greuous and continuall ſtryfes, contentions &amp; corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the matter of religion: Finally how terribly it ſhulde be vexed by the moſt cruell perſecutions of tholde Romane Empire, And laſte by the wicked crafts &amp; extreme Tyranny of Antichriſt. Al the which thinges apperteyne to this ende, that all the choſen being ſufficiently warned before, and prouided, in all ages whileſt this worlde ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, may with true faith alone, cleaue vnto Chriſt our redemer, king and high prieſte, only and eternall, and may purely and ſyncerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe hym, call vpon him, in the innocencie of lyfe, ſerue him, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently attend after him, commyng to Iudgemente, and to delyuer and ſaue the godly: But contrarywiſe, that they diſpiſe all ſuperſtitions and the worlde it ſelfe with thoſe his ſondrye religions, felicities and pleaſures: and bewar of al vngodlines. And chiefly that they flee An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt which ſhall com in thende of the worlde, vſurping to himſelfe moſt vniuſtly the kingdom and Prieſthod of Chryſt, and greuouſlye perſecuting the churche of Chriſt, euen to the laſte Iudgemente. In the whiche at the laſte he with all his adherentes, ſhall be throwen downe hedlonge into Hell.</p>
            <p>And. S.

Sauiour gouernour, Lorde and generall defendour of the Catholycke churche. For bleſſed. S. Iohn not only ſaw him ſuch him ſelfe, but alſo exhibiteth him ſuch, to be ſene of vs all in thys hys wryting ſo godly, by a moſt bryght and goodly viſion. And moreouer to thintent it myght be knowne to vs all, in what ſorte our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chryſt, king and prieſt ſitting or working in Heauen on the right hande of his Father, is neuertheleſſe in the middes of the catholycke church, wherof he hath a faithfull care, how louingly and fully he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth it, &amp; in beſt order gouerneth it. S. Iohn ſheweth in this his viſion, that Chriſt walketh amonge the ſeuen golden candleſtickes, &amp; holdeth in his right hande, ſeuen ſtarres. And ſtreyghtway declareth what thing he vnderſtandeth by the candelſtickes and ſtarres, calling the candelſtickes churches, and the ſtarres, Aungels of the churches. That is to witte,<note place="margin">Seuen chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> Meſſagers, miniſters and paſtours. For the Lord choſe vnto him ſelfe ſeuen famouſe churches in Aſia, with whom he treateth nowe generally and compendiouſly, vſing S. Iohn for hys
<pb facs="tcp:154393:7"/> interpretour: which he doth perpetually in all churches throughoute the world, and will neuer ceaſe to do tyll the worldes ende. For the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth number, whiche is moſt vſed in this boke,<note place="margin">Chap. 2, and .3</note> and is the numbre of fulnes, comprehendeth in it all churches. Wherfore S. Iohn doeth ſo propounde, moderate, and temper all thynges that he treateth with theſe ſeuen churches, that they may be applied vnto all the Churches that ſhalbe in the worlde, vntyl the worldes ende, for theyr learnynge and edifiyng. And for the ſame cauſe, theſe ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> churches may be exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all other churches. For loke what thing then, did pleaſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the Lord in thoſe ſeuen churches, what tyme theſe thyngs wer reuealed: the ſelfe ſame in all other churches, ſhall pleaſe or diſpleaſe him, ſo long as the worlde ſhall laſte. And as he wolde haue thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and taught: ſo wyl he that all and ſingular be inſtructed at all ſeaſons. Therefore in theſe ſeuen churches we haue examples of churches moſte excellent in dede, and of God derely beloued: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne of moſte corrupte, meane alſo, and finally mixed. And in theſe al is ſhewed, what is, or ſhall be, the diſpoſition, maners and vertues of all the churches in the whole world, and of al tymes and ſeaſons, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the vices of them and remedies of the ſame. Therfore the Lorde in theſe inſtructeth, reproueth, chideth, threatneth, exhorteth, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, promiſeth. Wherfore in theſe we ſhall ſee, as it were in a table ſet before vs, what the true and ryght doctrine of the churche is. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which is the falſe and the corrupt doctrine. We ſhall heare and learne, that the churche beloued of God, muſt ſtande ſtyll in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng of the Goſpell, once receyued of the Apoſtles of oure Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chryſt: and muſte loke for no new, nor other mo doctrines, and to haue no nede of other Reuelations: For the churche ys already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with a moſt complete doctrine. There is it taught alſo, what we ought to do with corrupte doctrines, and teachers. And where it is eaſy to fall into vices, this boke doth dilligently and plentifully mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter medicines, teaching, how the churche falling downe maie be ſet vp and repared againe: And here it treateth much of true repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, of the fruites of repentaunce, of the duties of Saincts or of very good workes. Moreouer, it exhorteth the afflicted to patience and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to the confeſſion of Chriſtes name, withoute feare, and to all godlynes: many times ſettyng forth the moſt ample rewardes of god, And alſo affirming that tourmentes are prepared for the diſobedient and reuoltes. By this waie &amp; meane. S. Iohn ſheweth to the church how our Lorde Ieſus Chryſt being in heauen, on the righthande of his father, in the meane tyme, &amp; neuertheleſſe worketh in the middes of the congregation of his faithful, inſpiring, quickenyng, kepyng and gouernyng it.

And who wyll not acknowledge this handlyng of the matter, to be all together Apoſtolicke, and right well grounded in the doctryne of Chryſt?

For where we beleue, that the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be of God, our redemer Ieſus Chriſt doth loue mankind ſo excedyngly, that neyther in heauen nor in earthe, maye any thyng be founde, that loueth vs more intierly: And now ſee the very ſame, and none other to open the ſeuen ſeales,<note place="margin">Seuen ſeales.</note> which opened, ſondry calamities iſſew out by and by, into the worlde: Who wold double, the ſame to be ſent to him for his health, ſince they are ſent not without his prouidence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, who directeth al thinges for the ſaluation of his choſen? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the which thinges, that notable matter is added, that al the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites Angelicall, thelders alſo, and all heauenlye creatures, worſhyp God and the Lambe, prayſe and commende his righteouſnes, and for his excedyng good gouernement, geue him immortall thankes.

<pb facs="tcp:154393:8"/> to learne, that we ſhuld acknowledg alſo, the iuſtice of God in all hys workes and not mumer at his gouernement and moſt rightfull iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: but rather to worſhip God, to ſubmit vs vnto him, to prayſe his righteouſnes, and geue thankes for his moſte holy gouernmente, and to crye with the prophet, thou art iuſt O Lorde, in all thy wayes,<note place="margin">Chap. vi.</note> and holy in all thy workes. Theſe thinges, being on thiſ wiſe promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the mindes of the faithfull, thus inſtructed and prepared, in the opening of the ſeuen ſeales, ſeuerally is accompted and rekned vp, what and how greate euils ſhuld inuade men, from the which not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful liuing in this world, ſhuld be free.

            <p>But becauſe this boke of the Apocalippes, is moſt euangelicall &amp; apoſtolical, it mingleth doubtles in all that declaration, often tymes ioyfull thinges with ſorrowful, and comforteth the faithfull exceding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in moſte and greateſt daungers. And therefore in the calamities,<note place="margin">Chap. vii.</note> troubles, euils and corruptions declared hitherto, the Aungel of God is brought in, who marketh the elect of God, in theyr foreheades: and all they in dede, throughe the goodnes and cuſtodye of God, are ſaued from perdition. And of theſe are accompted innumerable thouſandes. Wherby we learne that the mercy of God is moſte ample in ſauing of men: and that we ought to hope well, of the ſaluation of oure elders,<note place="margin">We muſt hope wel of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of oure forefathers.</note> wherof though the moſt part lyued vnder the corrupt tyme of Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, yet followeth not thereof, theyr ſaluation to be doubtfull, at the leaſt euen for this cauſe, that we ſee, that God had, &amp; hath his church at all tymes, euen when they be moſt daungerous: To haue hys ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to haue ſuche as worſhip hym, whiche like as in times paſte, haue not bowed theyr knees to Baall.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, by the which are denounced greuous conflicts of the faithful and infidels. Yet before that theſe things are expounded, Chryſt is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Throne of God, making interceſſion for vs. And to him are the faithful ſent, in their perils, to craue helpe of him, ſuccour, and deliueraunce. And the Deuil, maſter of lyes, bloweth the one, ſente to his men: Againe the holy ſpitite of God, ſoundeth the trompet to the Sainctes. They ioyne together in battell here, the godly and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the diſciples of the pure, and of the corrupt doctrine, the ſoldiours of Chryſt, and of the Deuil. Here are great daungers, and the minds of the godly ar more greuouſly afflicted and tempted with peruerſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trynes in the churche, then with the cruel ſworde of tyrantes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maner of calamities. Here are ſondry hereſies reſited, which impugne and corrupt the euangelical veritie. And as by the ſeuen ſeales he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtode al maner of calamities, by the iuſt iudgement of God powred out vpon the worlde: ſo vnder the ſeuen trompets, he comprehendeth al hereſies in the world, and pernitious opinions againſt thapoſtolical
<pb facs="tcp:154393:9"/> doctryne. And ſheweth that amonges thoſe corrupte deprauations, Mahometrie and Papiſtrie, did moſte excell. He deſcribeth the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and tedious clergie of the Pope,<note place="margin">Chap. ix.</note> whiche to men is euen intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vnder the kynde of graſſehoppers. And Lawrence Valla, a man excellently learned, though he was a Romane borne, and that of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble houſe.

And no leſſe euidently expreſſeth, the Turkiſhe crueltie, vnder the kind of terrible horſes breathing out ſmoke and fyres. By all the which thinges, he ſetteth forth the church to be moſte miſerab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted and tormented, vtterly after the ſame ſorte, that we ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vexed at this day, vnder the moſte vnhappie papiſtrie, &amp; mahometrie.</p>
            <p>Againe yet leſt any man ſhuld be in ſo great euils diſcouraged, and ſhuld thinke that God,<note place="margin">The Goſpel, or conſolation.</note> his promeſſes touching the endes of good and euill men, were vayne, &amp; alſo concerning the deliueraunce of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by the laſt iudgment. Agayne after the diſpoſition and maner A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall, he annexeth and ſetteth againſt all theſe perilles and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,<note place="margin">Chap. x.</note> a moſt ſtrong conſolation. For he bringeth forthe, the Lorde Chryſt hym ſelfe confirming by a ſolemne othe, that doubtleſſe an end of all theſe thynges ſhulde come: And that God of hys iuſtice wyll aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly render rewardes to the godly, and puniſhment to the wicked. Where he diſſembleth not, that Iohn himſelfe, ſhall prophecy again, to write in thapoſtolicall ſpirite and doctryne, to kynges, nations, and many people. Moreouer, he affirmeth manifeſtly that he wyll ſend in to the worlde,<note place="margin">Chap. xi.</note> teachers of the veritie, and of certayne ſaluation, which alſo moſt ſharply, ſhal rebuke the wickednes, and wicked men, of the moſte corrupt laſt age, ſhall preache Chriſt, ſincerly, and accuſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt moſt greuouſly. Theſe he ſhaddoweth by a figure of two excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent doctours. Whom he ſaith, for the libertie of preachinge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of fayth, ſhuld be moſt cruelly ſlayne of Antichriſt. But he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that theſe ſhall receyue of God, moſt ample rewardes: And that Antichriſt ſhall laboure in vayne to ſuppreſſe by fyre and ſworde, the preaching of the Goſpell: for ſo muche as the Lorde ſhall oftentymes ſtire vp new preachers, which ſhal lighten the truth obſcured. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth furthermore, that many ſhal daily reuolt from Antichriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that the ſame finally by the coming of the Iudge, ſhalbe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly brought to nought, and he maketh no concluſion, at this preſent in this place of the laſt iudgement of Chriſt, but differreth thexpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or treatyng of that matter, to an other place more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, which he treateth in the .xix. and .xx. Chapters. And theſe thinges hitherto hath he ſpoken generally of the perils, calamities, contentions, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſectes, and perſecutions of the churche of Chryſt, whiche ſhal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it from the time of Chryſt and his Apoſtles, to the worlds end. He annexeth conſequently, a ſingular or priuate, and that a plentifull treatiſe of the moſt greuous conflictes and perſecutions of the church.
<pb facs="tcp:154393:9"/> For it behoueth chieflye the ſainctes, to haue knowne theſe thynges, that in the veri perilles and afflictions, they may remember this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonition, and beare in minde, that the Lorde hathe tolde before,<note place="margin">Chap. xii.</note> of the things that they now ſuffer, who ruleth &amp; gouerneth al things, finally who can and wil delyuer them from al theſe euyls, when, how, and aſmuche as he of his good wyll ſhall ſee it good. Firſte therfore he propoundeth agayne, generally the partes of this conflicte or ſtrife, a woman clothed with the ſunne, crowned, traueling, which is a figure of the faithfull churche: he ſetteth againſt her a moſt fierſe and cruel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, I ſay the great dragon, Red, with ſeuen heades, &amp;c. A figure doubtles of that olde ſerpente, the Deuill.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte it is expreſſed the victory of Chryſt the head, and of the churche, and members of the ſame. Afterward the Lord by Iohn, rehearſeth, ſeuerally in the viſion, the ſpecial inſtruments or members of the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, by the which he aſſaulteth, and moſte cruelly vexeth,<note place="margin">Chap. xiii.</note> and werieth the church. And theſe inſtrumentes are, the beaſte with ſeuen heades and ten hornes, and the beaſt with two hornes, that is, thempire and falſe prophet, and the image of thempire.<note place="margin">Seuen heads of the beaſt.</note> Theſe thynges he painteth out after the Imutation of Daniell ſo liuely, and (as it is ſayd) with theyr owne colors, in the .xiii. and .xvii. Chap, that no man can chouſe but fele, and muche more perceyue, of whom he ſpeaketh: verely of the olde Romane Empire, and of Papiſtrie. He calleth beaſtes after the imitation of Daniell, cruell kyngdomes or empires. And the thyng it ſelfe declareth, that our very Lorde Ieſus Chryſt, the head and king of all Sainctes, ſuffered and was crucified vnder Ponce Pilate, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of Iuri, but ſent thither fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, and gouerning althinges in the name of Themperour Tiberius. Agayne, euery man knoweth that the firſt perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the Chriſtians, was ſtyred vp by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro Emperour of Rome. The ſeconde by Flauius Domitian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Rome, which intrapped alſo the Authour of this worke. And after this we reade of eyght other perſecutions or mo ſtyred vp by the reſidew of Romane Emperours, againſt the faithful ſpouſe of Chriſt by the whiche ſhe was cruelly rent in peaces and troden vnder foote. And that for no other cauſe, then for that ſhe woulde not worſhip the beaſte: that is, that ſhe wold not receyue the ſuperſtions and heathen rites of the Romane Empire. I meane the falſe Gods, and idolatrie of the Heathen. And for that ſhe worſhipped one God, alone through Chryſt, and cleaued to him &amp; ſeruid him, after his Goſpell. Here ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are excepted Conſtance, Conſtantine, Gracian, Theodoſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther godly and chriſten princes or Emperours, which be not rekened vnder the deueliſh beaſt. For an Empire or kingdom of it ſelfe, as. S Paule ſayeth, is of God: wherfore yf good men rule, and geue not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themſelues to be ruled of the Deuill, they ſhall verely appertaine to the body of holy church, and not to the abominable bodi of the beaſt. In the meane time, whileſt that olde Rome wold not ſeriouſly repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and tourne to Chryſt, forſaking theyr falſe gods and ſuperſtitions, at the laſt it was condemned of Chryſt, by the law of like penaltie. For
<pb facs="tcp:154393:10"/> with the ſame meaſure, that the Romanes met to other nations, with the ſelfe ſame, did other nations meaſure agayne to Rome. Wherfore the Perſians, Hunnes, Frencheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Alemans, weſt Gothians, Va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalles, and Eaſt Gothians, invaded thempire, &amp; rent the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in pieces. And at the laſt, beſeged Rome it ſelf, brake in to it, toke it, ſpoyled, ſacked, burnt &amp; deſtroyed it. And ſo at the length, the Lord Ieſus by iuſt iudgement, reuenged the bloud of his ſeruauntes. And Rome lay, and yet lyeth in ruine, and ſhall neuer be repared to the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient beautie. And it behoueth the ruine of it, to remayne in token of the veritie, and reuengment of Chriſt Ieſus: that euen therof al god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may gather, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God wyll be moſt true in thother promeſes of Chriſt alſo as yet not fulfilled.

The Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, began by little and little to gather to him no ſmal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and poſſeſſions, by the authorytie which he toke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him vnder the pretence of Chryſt and the Apoſtles Peter and Paule, tyll ſuch time as he began to reygne alſo.<note place="margin">The falle of tholde Empire is the ryſyng of a new.</note> But tholde Popes, his predeceſſours, wer not Princes in the Churche, ruling vnder pretence of Religion: but were miniſters of the churche, ſimple paſtours and poore.

But in this laſt boke of his. S.

In the meane time you wil ſay, there wanteth nothing in this boke, if you way euery thing more dilligently, whiche you ſhulde require of a boke moſte euangelicall and apoſtolicall. We haue in the ſame, not only expreſſed, but alſo well expounded the chief articles of our belefe. Moreouer, innumerable places of the prophets are expounded in this boke. For the whiche cauſe this.

Here is ſhewed moſt plenteouſly, what ſhal at the length be thend of good men and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll, what ſhal be the ſouerayne felicitie, and what the extreme miſery and infelicitie. In ſomuche that this boke maye euen by the thinge it ſelfe or matter, that it treateth and ſetteth forthe, commende it ſelfe to all godly people, and may ſhew and proue in dede, that it was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſpirite of thapoſtle.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe matters are ſetforth and handled after the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke maner, and accuſtomed facion of holy ſcripture,<note place="margin">By what meane and in what ſort theſe are ſetforth.</note> playne and ful of perſpicuitie. At the beginning God propounded diuine matters, and the which concerned our ſaluation, as it were vnder a veale, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der figures, not to thintente to darken or obſcure them: but rather to vnfolde them and ſet them foorth. For this maner of declaryng inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thyngs, by viſible, is more fit to teache, more mete to moue, more apt for perſpicuitie, and moſt conuenient and ſitting, that things may be more depely imprinted in minde, and the leſſe fall out of the ſame. And therfore we rede that ſondry viſions, were exhibited to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches, as to Abraham, Iſraell, Ioſeph, Moſes and others. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes yf you take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bokes of the Prophetes, the viſions, parables, and ſundry figures of ſpeache, how much, I pray you, ſhall you leaue of theyr doctryne? emongs theſe, be more notable in viſions, Ezechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, Daniel, and Zacharie. Neyther is thys maner of teachyng by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, parables, and ſundry figures, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away in the new teſtament, lyke as I haue ſhewed els where. The very ſtory of the Goſpel doth figurate and teache moſt thinges by parables. And. S. Iohn himſelf in his Goſpel, is veri much in the mention of light, darknes, of bread, water, of a Sheperd, and ſhepe, and ſuche other lyke. In the meane while I am not ignorant, howe great a difference, there is betwene parables, Metaphores or Allegories, and viſions: But who agayne knoweth not, that in teaching, and ſetting forth of matters the maner of either to be after a ſort al one, and of the ſame effect? For they ſerue
<pb facs="tcp:154393:13"/> for plainnes and perſpicuitie. But let ſuche as think not a miſſe, that Parables taken of earthly things, differ very muche from heauenlye viſions. Conſider, how theſe celeſtial viſions ar exhibited to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. S Iohn, by Chriſt now remayning in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and requiring that his ſeruauntes, hauing theyr mindes lifted vp to heauenly thinges, ſhuld learne to ſauour ſpirituall matters. Where he yet neuertheleſſe hath obſerued plaines and perſpicuitie.<note place="margin">The boke is plaine and may be vnderſtand.</note> I ſuppoſe verely this boke to be ſimple and playne to the faithful, that wil read it atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiuely &amp; with deuotion. I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that thold expoſitours of this boke haue ſticked ful oft in expounding the ſame, &amp; could not alwayes wind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues out: but in the meane ſeaſon it is euident, that the ſame men haue ſaid oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once, that hardely ſhuld this boke be vnderſtand before it wer fulfilled. And in dede to thoſe auncient fathers, the viſion of Daniell ſemed vtterly moſt obſcure. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch things wer accompliſhed, as he had hid vnder figures, there wanted not that ſayde, how he had wrytten a ſtory of things don, and not a prophecie of things to be don. And our lord him ſelf alſo in the Goſpel of S. Matthew. When you ſhall ſee, ſayth he thabomination of deſolation, which was ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of by Daniel the Prophet, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in the holy place, he that readeth let him vnderſtand. Doth not Eſay alſo in a maner in all his prophecies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the comming of Chriſt, and moſt of the miſteryes of the kyngdom of God accompliſhed, ſeme likewiſe to haue compiled a moſt playn hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory? And doubtles, if we reade with diligence this ſame boke of the Apocalips, &amp; confer thoſe things which he ſpeaketh vnder a ſhadow, with the ſame that ſtories teſtifie to be done: We ſhall ſay alſo, that he telleth plaine hiſtories. I haue verely loued this boke from my youth vpward, I haue gladly red in it, &amp; beſtowed much labour, ther vpon, obſeruing what things it had out of the bokes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets, &amp; howe the prophecies herof did agree with thother propheſies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets, &amp; doctrins of the Apoſtls. I haue ſearched finally, after the capacitie of my ſkle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der wit, diuers ſtories, which I thought to make for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the ſence of this prophecie. I haue ſearched alſo thopinions of other expoſitours: And haue diligentli compared domeſtical matters, which ar don now in our tyme, with this narration of Iohn: of al the which things, and chiefly being ayded by the helpe of God, whiche I called for, I haue gathered ſuch things as I now do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate here to the godly readers.

For God commaundeth the humbled to be of good hope, and to liue aſſured vnder the protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the higheſt. Which verely we vnderſtand to be ſpoken not to Iohn alone but to al vs alſo, that we in like maner, albeit that we fele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infirmitie of our fleſhe, ſhould yet hope well of the goodnes &amp; mercy of God. Here followeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cauſe more fully declared, why Iohn ſhold not be affrayed. For the viſion ſhewed was not exhibited for the terrour of him: but that Iohn might perceiue how great and mightie he is which is prepared for the defence of him &amp; al the faithfull. As though he ſhoulde ſaye. Where thou ſeeſt how great he is, which hath taken vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to defende thee, who finally protecteth and gouerneth the whole Churche, there is no cauſe why thou ſhouldeſt be affraide. But rather execute boldely, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth thee. Wryte that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth to be written. Be not affrayed of men, feare God rather. For if good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſo ſore afrayde at the ſight of him, where ſhal the enemies and contemners of God appere?</p>
               <p>Therfore conſequently he expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the viſion, teaching who he is, which was ſene like to the ſonne of man walking emonges the golden Candelſtickes. And he applieth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto comforte: that both Iohn &amp; euery faithful maye perceiue, how mightie Chriſt is, &amp; what the faithfull haue by him obteined. For the Aungell tempereth his ſpeach ſo, that we maie ſeme to heare al things ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs not by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of the Aungell, but of Chriſt him ſelfe.<note place="margin">A diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> And this expoſition hath his partes. For firſt he declareth (as I ſaid euen nowe) whoſe Image it was that was ſhewed. Than is annexed a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement to write this boke.

Finally y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecretnes of the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>delſticks is reuealed: And al theſe thinges right plainly and briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt thou haſt ſene, ſaieth the Lord, a viſion,<note place="margin">Chriſte is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſame viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what he is, and how great he is.</note> wherat thou waſte amaſed: but feare thou not. For thou haſt not ſene any euill or fearful ſpirite, boding any miſfortune: but my ſhape, whiche am thy redemer and Lorde. I am firſt and laſte. And this maner of ſpeakyng (as I warned a little before) he toke out of the Prophecies of <hi>Eſaye,</hi> as it is to be ſeene in the <hi>.xli. xliiii. xlv.</hi> and <hi>xlviii. chapters.</hi> And he ſignifieth him ſelfe to be coequall, and of the ſame ſubſtaunce with the father in all

For loke what thinges the father attributeth to himſelf, the ſame alſo doth the ſonne vſurpe. But there is no order or time certain to be vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in firſt and laſt, but plainly euerlaſtingnes. Therfore Chriſt here ſignifieth,<note place="margin">Chriſt is egall with the father.</note> that he is very God, egalle and of the ſame eſſence with the father from all eternitie. As the ſame is alſo muche confirmed in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5.10.14. and 17. chapter. This fighteth againſt the Heretickes, which at that time alſo, as at this daye the Seruetanes, denie the eternall deitie of Chriſt the Lorde.

For I am God, ſayeth the veritie: And beſides me there is no God, no Saluation.</p>
               <p>Secondly he ſayeth, I am liuing, and was dead: wherby he ſignifieth that he toke the true humane nature. The whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che many alſo at the ſame time denied: In like caſe as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By this is ſignified the iudiciall powerful of equitie and iuſtice, and alſo the deliueraunce of the good, and puniſhement of the euill, for the ſworde is geuen to the magiſtrate, as an authoritie to puniſhe the euill, and defende the good. Chriſt him ſelf defendeth his, and his aduerſaries he heweth in pieces. The ſworde is the very worde of God moſt ſharpe, two edged and pearſing the very hartes, for it animateth the godly, and diſcourageth the wicked. Chriſte therfore gouerneth his Churche, as a Iudge and defendour moſte rightfull and iuſte, whiche hath his ſworde not in his handes, but in his mouthe, and with his ſpirite and worde comforteth and preſerueth the faithful: but feareth and wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Full rightly therfore is this beginning applied to the cauſe that followeth touching the croſſe of the faithfull: And expulſing and fliyng the Nicolaitans.

               <p>He ſayeth howe he is not ignoraunt, where the church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> dwelleth: euen there verely where Sathan hathe fixed his ſeate or throne.

Chriſte therfore is not ignoraunt of the labours, ſorowes and temptations of the faithfull. And the knoweledge of Chriſte hath a certen peculiar thinge. For
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:154393:67"/> Chriſt ſo knoweth the matters of the faithful that he is both touched with the ſame, and hathe alſo a conſideration or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of his ſeruauntes. And we ſee howe Chriſt alſo placeth his throne there, where the Deuill hathe his ſeate iuſt by. At the length he thruſteth him out of his ſeate.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Pergamos the ſeate of Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>And for two cauſes Pergamos ſemeth to be called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeate, throne, and kingdome of the deuill. For firſt as Aretas hath admoniſhed, in ſuperſtition and worſhippinge of Idolles it excelled all Aſia, whiche neuertheleſſe was moſte corrupte. Pergamos was the moſt auncient and famouſe citie of Aſia or of Miſia and Phrygia, renomed by kinge Attalus &amp; Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus. For the ſame was the Princelyke palace of kinge Attalus, whiche came into the handes of the Romans by the legacie of kings, who were moſt addicte to idolatrie. Strabo ſpeaketh muche herof in the 13. boke. Moreouer this place was alſo, as Plinie ſemeth to ſignifie in the 5. boke, the 30. <hi>Chapt.</hi> moſte noble and frequented, by reaſon the liftenant or gouernour there inhabited, who at the commaundement of the emperour. Domitian, perſecuted the trewe faithe of Chriſt, impriſonyng, ſcourging and afflicting al that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt. By good reaſon therfore is Pergamos called the ſeate or Throne of the Deuill. For he is a liar, and the father of liyng, and a murtherer from the beginnynge: whiche the Lorde alſo teſtifieth in the 8. of <hi>Iohn.</hi> For bycauſe therfore at Pergamos reigned heathennes, liynge, Idolatrie, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the oppreſſion and murther of good men, it is rightly called the ſeate or throne of the deuill. This appereth to be a ſclaunder not to be diſſembled, or ſuffered. For Rome ſemed to her ſelfe eſtabliſhed for euer,<note place="margin">Rome the ſeate of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</note> and the whiche the Goddes fauoured, who had ſent them victorye ouer moſte greate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and geuen the Empire of the whole worlde: In the whiche citie iuſtice and religion mighte ſeme to be obſerued. And therfore that this ſeate of iuſtice and religion ſhoulde be called the ſeate of Sathan, mighte be thought bothe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and treaſon. But this doeth the onlye begotten ſonne of God from the right hande of his father pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce againſt Rome, agaynſt Pergamos, and agaynſt all the confortes of Rome. Who ſhall accuſe him of temeritie, of raſſhenes, or of bitter ſpeakyng? light perſons are doubtleſſe angry, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

For ſuche is the glory of vertue, that all men coueth the ſame euen the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen enemies of vertue, ſo that no man will ſeme to be voide of vertue: and ſuch is the corruption and darkenes of mans minde, that he would be that he is not, and wold not be that he is. Therof cometh al this impatience in the whole world: when a mattocke is called a mattocke, and a figge a figge as the prouerbe is. Is an harlot therfore no harlot, becauſe ſhe will not be called an harlot? yes verely is ſhe an harlot, and a ſhameful harlot, and though ſhe denye neuer ſo ofte that ſhe is a whore, yet is ſhe an whore neuertheleſſe, and remayneth a whore. So the ſeate or Throne of Sathan is at this daye Rome it ſelfe, whiche will ſeme to be the ſeate of Chriſte and the ſeate Apoſtolical. For the worke and inſtruction of the deuill therein aboundeth. Finally al Cities, Townes,<note place="margin">Where is the ſeate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil.</note> &amp; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherin veritie, godlines, religion and vertue are exiled, wherin the preaching of Gods trueth, and correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of moſt corrupte maners haue no place, wherein filthines and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanes, baudy ſonges and not ſpirituall Pſalmes, wherin crafte and diſceipte, ſurfetting, murther, aduoutrie, oppreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good people and of godly religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pheth, be the ſeates of Sathan, how ſo euer they be called the moſte chriſten and catholicke cities, and worſhippers of the righte and chriſten ſaith. This thing Ieſus Chriſt the very ſonne of God ſaieth, crieth, affirmeth, repeteth, and euen with a maieſtie pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth. For by and by after the murther of Antipas, he addeth: where ſathan dwelleth. And theſe thinges are doubtles true, whiche Chriſt ſayeth and pronounceth in the Churche: and moſt falſe be the thinges whiche this moſt ſinful world here alledgeth againſt the wordes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But this ſame the Lord highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth, that in ſo ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; vnfortunate a place they haue ſtande vprightly hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and coulde not be ſubdued in the verye ſeate of Sathan.<note place="margin">To dwell in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mids of a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

There is a meaſure in al thinges, as the common ſaiynge is.

In Chriſt the churche is without any ſpotte or wrincle as the Lorde ſayeth in the 13. of <hi>Iohn.</hi> And in the countrie to come ſhal moſte fully be made perfit: whiche S. Auſten alſo affirmeth.</p>
               <p>And the Lorde Ieſus reprehendeth in the churche of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamos, not that they mainteyne the Nicolaitan or Galaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitical doctrine, but that they haue ſuche as maintayne that doctrine. They offended therefore, for that they did not hate ſo muche the Nicolaitans as the Epheſians did:<note place="margin">They of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende that haue them whiche maynteyne wicked do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> of whome we hearde in the firſte epiſtle, that they coulde not abide the wicked.

               <p>Moreouer he deſcribeth the hereſie of the Nicolaitans to

I tolde you before how they were moſte filthie thinges, which the auncient wryters reporte of the Nicolaitans. But all things are moſt aptely and chaſtely declared of Chriſt. They are taken out of the 22. 23. 24. 25. <hi>chapter</hi> of the fourth boke of Moſes called <hi>Numeri.</hi> He calleth the Nicolaitan doctrine, the doctrine of Balaam, and that by a ſimilitude. In Balaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſouthſayer theſe wicked actes are manifeſte: whereof it maye eaſely appere, of what ſorte his doctrine was. Firſt he toke the rewarde or price of iniquitie as ſ. Peter termeth it: And woulde curſe them whome God hathe bleſſed, doynge cleane contrary to his owne minde. Secondly he geueth the king moſte peſtilent counſell: whiche the Scripture therfore calleth a ſclaunder or offence. For he taught the king a waie or meane, wherby he mighte intiſe the people of God into certaine deſtruction, into the moſt vncleane feding of meats offered to Idolles, and into moſte filthie whoredome. Al this than ſhall be compted the doctrine of Balaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche in hope of filthy lucre beyng vttered agaynſte Gods worde and his owne conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, teacheth Idolatrie, vncleane eating, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: or reproueth not, but counſelleth rather, when he knoweth the thing to be filthy. Euen ſo did the Nicolaitans, in ſpeaking euill of the trueth and of chriſten purenes, gaue naughtie counſell to many, that they ſhould be partakers of meates offered vp to Idolles, and couple with harlots, as in the firſt epiſtle I declared more at large.</p>

Great therfore is faith, that is, fidelitie, and veritie: That not with out cauſe the Apoſtle required this of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the .14. chap. of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſaying: That ſame is chieflye required of Stewardes, that a man be found truſty.

Let vs hartely praie to the Lorde, that he wyll graunte vs the ſame, and that we maye expulſe out of our breſtes vnfaithfulnes, and diſceiptfulnes.</p>
               <p>Hereunto is added patience,<note place="margin">Patience. 4.</note> whiche is prayſed alſo in the fourmer churches. Which is a neceſſary vertue. For impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entnes cauſeth vs to murmur and grudge againſt God, that we ſtande not ſtrong in the confeſſion of faith, whileſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſuffer patiently ſuche thinges as the ennemies of faith threaten to put vs to.

For becauſe thou lackeſt pacience in thy pouertie, which thou wilt releue with wicked doynges.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord now reciteth al maner of good works:<note place="margin">To abond in good workes. 5.</note> Wherin he chiefly commendeth, that many tymes they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled them ſelues, in doing more and greater thinges.

               <p>And moſte ſhame of all it is, to be euer the longer the worſe. As the finger, the longer the leſſe: Whiche is obiected to chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren in ſcholes that learne nothing. Let vs be aſhamed of our ſloughtfulnes. &amp;c. Let vs I ſay way theſe thinges dilligently in our myndes: and thinke oft, that God alloweth them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth them, and that they be the true ſeales of the faithfull walking in the veritie, and of ſuche as boaſte of faith only a vaine name without the thing. If thou fele thy ſelfe not to be vtterly voyde of theſe giftes, prayſe God: and knowe that none of all theſe thinges is of thy ſelfe, but of grace: And pray for the increaſe of theſe giftes.

The firſt ſort the Lord Ieſus accuſeth in this Epiſtle by S. Iohn: And ſheweth alſo a medicine for the diſeaſe. And the la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter he exhorteth to perſeueraunce, commending their integri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie. Therfore this Epiſtle is deuided in two partes, verey fit and profitable for our time.</p>
               <p>The firſt part of the Epiſtle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth thoſe things which we haue now recited: Nether doth he procede herein in other order, than we haue ſene him to haue proceded hitherto. For firſt he ſheweth to whom it is dedicated, and ſent: Namely to the Paſtour of the congregation of Sardis,<note place="margin">Sardis.</note> and therfore alſo to the whole church. Sardis is ſaid to haue ben the head citie of Lydia or of Maonia, the metropolitane citie of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the moſt riche king of Lydia, whom Herodotus writeth that king Cyrus ouercame, a towne moſt famous, and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and painted with pride, that it was a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der: And addicte to voluptuouſnes. For <hi>Strabo</hi> in the <hi>.xiii.</hi> boke of <hi>Geographie</hi> teſtifieth that al the maidens therof were harlots, who men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth more of the ſame citie. Certes it ſemeth to haue kept his olde wonte, euen at ſuche time alſo as it had receiued the name of the Lord: And therfore to haue bene more geuen to fornication, and al maner of filthy luſt. The which thing the Lord ſemeth to haue blamed in them, as S. Paul likewyſe perſecuted the ſelf ſame viſe in the Corinthians. The worlde can hardly beleue that ſimple fornication is ſinne wherupon in that great counſel of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Actes. 15.</note> both thei and the elders
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:154393:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> and the whole aſſemblie with one minde decreed, that the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould abſteine from fornication. The deuill at this day goeth about many times to defile the church again with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, to ſet vp ſtewes, and that by authoritie and openly whordom might be practiſed. For ſo being caſt out, he taketh ſeuen worſe ſpirites, enterpriſing to poſſeſſe that place again out of the whiche he was exiled by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. We muſt therfore reſiſt him, leaſt the Lorde Ieſus him ſelf do accuſe vs, as he doth here accuſe them of Sardis moſt greuouſly.<note place="margin">Chriſt hath and ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the ſpirite.</note> Then is the Lord Ieſus declared to be authour of the Epiſtle, not without praiſe. For he is ſaid to haue the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſpirites of God, that is to haue the ſeuen fourmed ſpirit, whom he alſo powreth out vpon the faithful, or els he is one only ſpirit, and not ſeuen: but ſeuen, that is to witte, his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be many and diuerſe, as I declared in the firſt chapter, for the ſame hath alſo in his right hand ſeuen ſtarres, to witte, the whole multitude of all preachers and miniſters, keping and inſtructing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this beginning agreeth not amiſſe with this argument, which he treateth in this Epiſtle. For of the ſpirite of Chriſt is life: Of the want of the ſpirit, death. Chriſt preſerueth the miniſters, how angrie ſo euer me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ar in the churche, with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for accuſing their wickednes. Priuely therfore he warneth them, to craue the ſpirite, to noriſhe the lyfe ſpirituall: And to truſt in Chriſte, which wil defende the miniſters, and auaunce them.</p>

The whiche alſo <hi>S. Peter</hi> repeted in the 2. chapter of his latter epiſtle.

               <p>But that ſame excellent thinge is chiefly to be obſerued,<note place="margin">What is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the church of Sardis.</note> that although they were but fewe good, yet neuertheles the Lorde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth and extolleth thoſe fewe, doubtles for the example and imitation of al other churches. The wordes in dede are ſhorte, but the praiſe moſte ample and large. That they had not defiled their garmentes: whiche is as muche as if he had ſayed, you haue not polluted your ſoules with ſtraunge opinions or ſpottes of hereſie. For you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned ſincere in the true faythe: your bodies alſo, and the whole conuerſation of your life, you haue not defiled with filthie luſtes, with fleſhely pleaſures and voluptuouſenes. Doubtles this is the greateſt prayſe and moſt certaine ſigne of perfit godlines: wherewith I would wiſhe that mo of vs were marked. But the maner of ſpeache here requireth alſo an expoſition.<note place="margin">The alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie of ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parell in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture.</note> The allegorie of garments is often and much vſed in holy ſcripture. The vſe of apparell inuented of God him ſelfe, and ſhewed to our forefathers, hath this chiefe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, to hide the priuie partes of our body, to beautife and ſet forth the body, and kepe of heate and colde. And therfore Chriſt him ſelf is called the garment of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and in the goſpel in dede the wedding garment. Whervpon thapoſtle aduiſeth vs to put on the new ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is made after God euen Chriſt him ſelfe. <hi>Roman.</hi> 13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. For Chriſt couereth not only our priuie partes, but all the filthines alſo of the ſoule, he adorneth and beautifieth vs, and driueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs all iniurie, and all euill.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:154393:84"/> when neither in faith nor in holines of life we do aunſwer to our profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For Chriſte is our garment, and Chriſtianitie, ſincere faithe, and holines of life are our apparell: And euen faithe and our conuerſation is our garmente. For aſmuche therfore as the Sardenſians were of a ſincere fayth, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupte maners, they are ſaied to haue kepte their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts cleane and vndefiled. The lorde alſo geueth nowe a rewarde vnto vertu.<note place="margin">To walke with chriſt in where graye.</note> And they ſhal walke with me, ſayeth he, in white araye.

Sainctes walke with Chriſt in white araye, that is to ſaye, haue fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame glory, wherin we beleue Chriſt to ſhine. For he deſireth his father, that he will graunt to the faithfull, that where ſo euer he is, they may be with him, and ſee his glory, &amp;c. in the 17. of <hi>Iohn.</hi> And with <hi>S. Matth.</hi> in the tranſformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or clarifiyng, the face of Chriſt appered bright like the ſunne, his apparell and reſt of his body as light. So appered Chriſt vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> in the firſt chapt. of this boke, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in white araye.

This is the greateſt prayſe, when the Captaine ſayeth, that the ſoldiour is worthy of honour and glory. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſhame or ignomie is, when it is ſayed with vs, thou arte vnworthy. The firſt kind of ſpeache ſheweth him to be moſt excellent in al kinde of vertue, whiche is ſayed to be worthie of eternal light, by the later is ſignified, that he whiche is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted vnworthy of a good and excellent thing, is marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe negligent and vngraciouſe. But here we nede not to reaſon of the merite and deſerte of worthines. God pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his to be worthie of glory, the godly referre al the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that is in them vnto grace, and ſtill complaine of theyr vnworthines. Not to reproue God of liyng, but to prayſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende the excellent goodnes that is in him: acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging in dede that he rewardeth good workes, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the worthines of ſainctes: but they are nothing proude hereof, but acknowledge al this to come of grace. This appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the doctrine of the Goſpell, <hi>Luke.</hi> 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. where
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:154393:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> Sainctes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended of God, for the workes of mercy, ſeme the acknowledge nothing therof.</p>
               <p>Howbeit he declareth more at large the moſt ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſſes of God,<note place="margin">Greate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes of vertue.</note> wherby he maye not onlye reteyne in their duty the Sainctes and vndefiled Sardenſians, but mighte alſo reduce al others that go aſtray at al times into the waye of repentaunce, integritie, and holines. And three thinges he promiſeth: firſt in dede, white apparell, that is to ſaye, glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng, and light euerlaſtinge, and the gloriouſe company of Chriſt, wherof I haue ſpoken already. Secondly, and I wil not, ſayeth he, put out his name out of the boke of life. For like as Cities haue bokes, wherin the names of theyr Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are written:<note place="margin">The boke of life.</note> righte ſo is God in the ſcriptures ſayed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (after the maner of men) to haue a boke of life, or of his electe. What that boke is, and whoſe name is red in the ſame, none of vs can tell, ſins none hath loked therein. We muſt learne of the ſcriptures, who be the citeze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. For that theyr names be written in the boke of life no man nede doubt. And S. Iohn ſayeth: ſo many as haue beleued, he hath geuen them power, that they maye be made the children of God. S. Paull ſaieth: He that hath not the ſpirite of Chriſte, he is none of his. And the ſpirite crieth in the mindes of the godly, Abba father. The ſame Apoſtle ſayeth: God hath predeſtinated vs, that he might adopte vs for his children, through Ieſus Chriſte. Moreouer: he hath choſen vs in Chriſt, before the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations of the world were layde. Therefore are al beleuers written in that numbre cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall. Who ſo euer therefore beleue not, or perſeuere not in the faith, eyther they are not written in the boke of life, or els they be put out againe of the boke of lyfe. Finally the ſonne acknowledgeth the beleuers and ſuch as perſeuer in the true faythe, before his heauenly father, and his Aungelles. And here he repeteth theuangelicall doctrine out of the 10. chapt. of <hi>S. Matth.</hi> and 8. of <hi>S. Marke.</hi> And doubteles it is a greate matter in that vniuerſall iudgement, to be knowen of the ſonne of God, of the highe iudge, to be ſaluted and frendely ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to of him, and that to our greate prayſe. If any Prince would in a great aſſemble of people knowe thee, yea imbraſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende thee, howe happie and fortunate woldeſt thou

               <p>And the lord herin followeth the ſame order, which we ſee he hath followed in others. For it is one &amp; the ſame kinde of doctrine with all churches and in al times.

The ſame loueth holines in ſainctes. Chriſt therfore is moſte truely called. Antichriſt the Pope hath taken vpon him this title, and ſo filthy ſitteth on this beaſte, as if you ſhould call a priuie or a Iakes a Roſier.

The trueth of the Lorde indureth for euer. Thou ſtandeſt vpon a moſte ſure foundation, if thou leane vnto Chriſte, whiche in the 14. of <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo calleth him ſelfe the veritie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The keye of Dauid.</note>Laſte he addeth, whiche hath the keye of Dauid. I ſpake of the keye in the firſte chapter.

The ſame caſteth doune the vncleane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hel, nother is there that can deliuer or differ the ſame. He ſayeth therfore aptely and expreſſely, he hath, not had or ſhal haue, but he hath now. For he alone hath this power, which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth with no man els. The Pope of Rome lieth, whiche ſayeth that he hathe this power.

But theſe thinges agree righte well with thoſe that follow of the opened dore, which no man can ſhut, and ſo to the whole matter.</p>
               <p>For now the Lorde procedeth to tell, what he would: And as he hathe ſayed in all epiſtles, he repeteth in this alſo, that he knoweth al things of this and of al other congregations.</p>
               <p>And he commendeth ſo the perſeueraunce in faithe in this congregation,<note place="margin">Thou haſt no power.</note> that he ſignifieth with all, that the ſame alſo did procede of the grace of Chriſt. Thou haſte, ſayeth he, litle
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:154393:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> power, and as it were no force and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, which this world regardeth, as power, riches, wordly wiſedom, lucky ſucceſſe, plentie of frendes, and ſuch other like things. Therfore thou canſte attribute nothing to thy ſelfe, nothinge to thine owne ſtrength, not ſo much as this that thou arte a churche, &amp; that the veritie of the goſpell is freely preached with thee.<note place="margin">I haue ſet before thee an open dore.</note> For I ſet ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this dore. And by my ſtrength I kepe open the ſame, that no man can ſhut the ſame dore: to witte the preachinge and grace ones graunted, by any meanes to prohibite, let, or take away. To open the dore, is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon phraſe of ſpeaking, vſed of thapoſtle, in the 1. to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> 16. and the 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> the 2. He openeth the dore, whiche geueth an occaſion, and prepareth the waye to enter in. By the worde therefore was opened the dore of life. The faithful might enter in: the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels coulde not ſtoppe this waye. For the hande of Chriſte helde the dore open. And theſe thinges in dede do declare,<note place="margin">No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhut y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dore</note> whereof it is that in cities, townes, and villages not greatly furniſhed with any force or power, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courſe of the goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cedeth with ſo lucky ſucceſſe: And where many go about by layng waite, craftes and policies, threateninges and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſhut the dore, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not. Theſe things are not done through our cunning &amp; wiſedome, but of the grace of God.</p>
               <p>Howbeit if any man liſt to vnderſtand thoſe thinges and ſuch as follow herafter peculiarly of the paſtour or biſhop of the church, I wil not be againſt it. For where he was hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, and inſtruct with no worldly wiſedome, yet furniſhed with God his grace, he opened the waye of ſaluation, which now they coulde not ſhut vp, as many as ſoughte to abrogate the preaching of the goſpel. The vertue of Chriſt kept him.</p>
               <p>And nowe more expreſſely he preacheth or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth the faithfull conſtauncie in faithe of the paſtour &amp; congregation:<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce in faythe.</note> Thou haſt kept, ſaieth he, my worde, and haſt not denied my name.

This is an excellent praiſe. Would God there were many ſuch churches founde at this daie. Here mayeſt thou learne alſo, O thou church of Chriſt, here maye you learne all and ſingular, what is the duty of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:154393:87"/> paſtours, of the churche, and of all and ſingular godly men and women. Thy merite was none at all, God of his grace ſhone vnto thee. Thy worthines was non, thy deſert, power nor authoritie: Chriſte of his mercy hath reuealed him ſelfe vnto thee. Imbrace him therefore that offereth him ſelfe to thee, holde faſt and neuer at any time let him go. &amp;c.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The word of Chriſt is to be kepte.</note>And note that the Lord ſayeth, my worde, not euery mans worde, but mine. What the worde of Chriſt is, it is knowen to al men. For that which is written in the Goſpel, and firſt in dede by the Prophetes, and after by the Apoſtles was ſet forth in holy writte, is the worde of chriſt. It is not Chriſtes worde that ſtriueth with the ſame, although it be ſet forth by Counſels and holy fathers. Chriſte doeth not acknowledge that worde: he acknowledgeth his for his owne. And this muſt be obſerued and kept. The word of Chriſt is obſerued, what time it is not corrupted with additions,<note place="margin">The word of Chriſt is kepte howe.</note> detractions, and wraſtinges, but in caſe it be kepte ſincere in his naturall ſenſe.

He ſetteth forth him ſelfe with a new name, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him, Ho amen, that Amen.

And theſe thinges accorde right wel to this argument, wherin he reproueth the Laodicians of ſinne, and exhorteth them to repentaunce.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do I not ſeparate faith from the worde, and ſay therfore that the pure and ſincere faith is ſignified by golde. Wherof S. Peter ſaid, that the faith of our hartes be pourged. For although there be in vs ſpottes and infirmities, yet is faith, by reaſon of the ſubiect wherupon he reſteth, moſte pure.</p>
               <p>The worde of promiſſion, and euen Chriſte hym ſelfe is the obiect of faith, whiche is the very purenes it ſelfe. Wherfore the Lorde counſelleth that the Congregation of Laodicea, ſhould bye golde tried, he counſelleth that they ſhould heare Gods worde, and beleue it in deede. For the Lorde vſeth the worde of byeng, for receiuynge, hearynge, and obeying.</p>

               <p>Moreouer the vſe and profit of this pure golde,<note place="margin">The vſe &amp; fruicte of pure gold.</note> tried and moſte purified, I meane, the word of Gods veritie and pure fayth, is three ſortes.

For the worde of God and fayth in hym, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true pietie. Without the worde and faith nothinge is ſounde.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell of the faithfull.</note>The ſecond fruict, is the clothing &amp; comly apparel, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are couered, that our ſhameful nakednes ſhould not appere.

Becauſe ſinne bringeth ſhame, and want of al good workes: And an euill conuerſation, is a moſte ſhameful nakednes.</p>
               <p>With this were the Laodiceans infected. But Chriſt, whiche is learned by the word of truth, and perceiued by true fayth, is the white apparel of the faithfull, their rightuouſnes &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie. He couereth al our ſpottes, he abholiſheth our ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefull nakednes, decketh vs with all kinde of vertues, that we may appere honeſt and comly before God in holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation. For Chriſt is the wedding garment. The Apoſtle counſelleth vs to put on Chriſt, &amp; that we be appareled with rightuouſnes, temperaunce, and all goodnes.

               <p>Finally with this gold is bought an eie ſalue, which is a medicine for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies,<note place="margin">Sight is reſtored.</note> which Phiſitions are wont to lay to ſore and blere eies, againſt blindnes.

               <p>For all theſe thinges the Lord counſelleth the Laodicians, to ſeke for Gods word, and beleue it verely. For ſo it ſhould come to paſſe, that being inriched with al ſpiritual giftes, thei might leade a pure conuerſation in the church, might poſſeſſe Chriſt, and iudge rightly of al matters of ſaluation.

Theſe thinges are ſpoken of the Lord in the <hi>.vi.</hi> of <hi>Iohn.</hi> And in the xiiii. chapt. he ſaith. He that loueth me, wyll kepe my worde: And my father and I will come vnto hym, and will make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode with him. S. Paul ſaith that he liueth not nowe, but that Chriſt liueth in hym. The ſame affirmeth that Chriſt through faith dwelleth in the hartes of the faithfull. And ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord entreth the hartes of them that let hym in. Not the leaſt part of felicitie conſiſteth in this coniunction. For to be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God, is bleſſednes, whiche beginneth here, and is made perfit in an other lyfe. And therfore in the ſecond place the Lord ſaith: And I will ſuppe with him, and he with me. Wherby he noteth not only againe a moſte dere frendſhip &amp; familiaritie (for the table is conſecrate to amitie) but rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruition of eternall glory. For by the ſupper are ſignified, the ioyes celeſtiall, greateſt, and vnſpeakeable, which after their ſoules the Godly receiue immediatly after death: But more fully in the ende of tymes, when the bodies ſhal ariſe againe. Therfore is it not applied to a diner, but to a ſupper, as it is alſo in the .14. of <hi>Luke.</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if we receiue Chriſt, we ſhal haue him dwelling w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually, whileſt we liue in this world.

               <p>The thirde parte of this worke reacheth from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 4. chapter, vnto the beginning of the 12. chapter. And conteyneth a notable viſion, moſte holeſome, and of muche fruicte. The firſt viſion, which we hearde expounded in the 3. chap. exhibiteth a figure of Chriſt, and of his church, and howe the Lord reigneth in the ſame, how alſo the church behaueth or oughte to demeane her ſelfe. In the ſeconde vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion S. Iohn declareth, howe by a moſt iuſte and moſt holy gouernement God gouerneth all thynges by Chriſt, which chaunce and are done to the churche in the worlde and of the worlde.<note place="margin">The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſeconde vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> In theſe are rehearſed the moſt ſorrowful deſtenies of the church, calamities, plages, and deſtructions, famines, perſecutions, reuoltinges, hereſies, conflictes, and other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles moſte greuouſe of the ſame ſorte. &amp;c. Who alſo and what and howe iuſte God is, rightuouſe and holy in all his iudgementes, here is deſcribed: That he is Authour of all: That God throughe the moſte wittie and excellent gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of Chriſte ruleth all thinge: that the holy Aungelles alſo and al creatures do acknoweledge him, and geue glory
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:154393:99" rendition="simple:additions"/> vnto God. For ſo it teacheth vs alſo in al our doynges,<note place="margin">Thende of this viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and euen in the very greuouſe calamities and perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it ſhall prophecie moreouer, the acknoweledge the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and good wil of God towardes vs, and his moſt iuſte gouernement. This if we ſhal do with quiet mindes, we ſhal beare alſo moſte heauy burthens patiently: we ſhall ceaſe with curiouſe queſtions to inquire, whye God permitteth Antichriſt to ſpring vp, to increaſe and reigne, to oppreſſe the religion and Sainctes of God? Then ſhal ceaſe alſo the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſe mutinyng of thoſe, which are not affraide to ſaye. God is in dede the Lorde, he is almightie, he doeth what he will, and as he will: we are bonde ſeruauntes, and rather worſe than bondemen. We are forced to beare what ſo euer he wil laye vpon vs, &amp;c. As thoughe God were vniuſte, and after a tirannicall feare terrible, and ruled after a carnal luſt. It is moſt ſhameful to thinke thus, much more to ſpeake it. This viſion ſhal declare, that God by his prouidence gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth althinges, and that the ſame is iuſt in al his wayes, and holy in al his workes.</p>
               <p>And firſte S. Iohn is prepared to receyue this viſion,<note place="margin">A prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this viſion.</note> yea and we alſo are prepared in him. For when he had ſene the dore in heauen to be wyde open, he hearde withall, come vp hither, &amp;c. It is ſurely a benefite not to be expreſſed with tonge, that the Lorde openeth heauen for vs miſerable men mortall, and ſuffereth vs to ſee what is done therin, or what he him ſelfe doeth there, and what his workes or iudgments be towardes men. Let no man ſaye herafter, that God doeth in Heauen what thinges he liſte, not paſſinge vpon vs that crepe vpon earthe, and who alſo muſte ſuffer that we woulde not. For nowe he maketh as it were an accompte of his workes and beyng aſſured admitteth thee as a looker on of the matter.</p>
               <p>And here he declareth with a godly voice,<note place="margin">The mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de muſte be lifted vp.</note> what Iohn ſhuld do, and how he ſhould behaue him ſelf.

For after the Tipe of God, orderyng or gouernyng al thinges iuſtely through Chriſte, immediately are declared the deſtenies of the churche by ſeuen ſeales, and ſeuen trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes, in the which are euery where interlaced moſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable conſolations and ful of efficacitie.</p>

He that ſitteth therin, holdeth in his right hande a boke, cloſed with Seales. By him that ſate ſtode a lambe, whiche taketh the boke, and openeth the Seales therof. And out of this Throne alſo procedeth a ſeuenfolde ſpirite, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully vtteryng his vertues. Before the ſeate appeareth a glaſſie Sea, bright, and euen like Chriſtal.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:154393:100" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the reuelation of Chriſt. For we reade that ſuch maner of viſions were exhibited for the moſte parte to the prophetes, as to <hi>Eſaye</hi> in the 6. <hi>chapt.</hi> To <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 1. <hi>and</hi> 11. <hi>chapt.</hi> And to <hi>Daniel</hi> in the 7. <hi>chapt.</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">A Throne.</note> And a Throne ſignifieth a maieſtie imperiall &amp; adminiſtration iudicial.

For God the iudge of all is of a quiet minde, neyther is he moued with any affections like men.

For the worke of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil he render to him, and accordynge to the wayes of euery one he wil rewarde them. For verely God will not conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne in vaine, neyther will the almightie ſubuerte iudgement, &amp;c.

For albeit that afterwarde mention be made of a righthande holdyng the boke, yet is here no ſhape of manne exhibited. But he ſayeth alſo ſimply one ſitting, he geueth him no name. The cauſe is ready: for God by his nature ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be defined, as he that is inuiſible, and vnmeaſurable: After the maner of men in dede humane membres are attributed to him, but to be expounded by a trope.

               <p>And firſt is ſhewed in what place of the throne the beaſtes were:<note place="margin">Where in the throne be the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes.</note> to witte in the middes of the Throne, and in the circuit of the ſame. You wil are, if they be in the throne, how ſhould they be about the Throne? if they be about the Throne, how be they in the middes of the Throne? The thynge muſte be ſo conceaued, as I admoniſſhed alſo before, that we ſhould vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, that vnder the Throne the middes of the beaſtes doe with their hinder partes reache to the middes of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:154393:104"/> Throne inwardely, and ſo as it were to haue borne vp the Throne: And with their fore partes, I meane, with theyr breſtes, and heades and winges to haue ſtande forth, and ſo to haue compaſſed the Throne, and as it were inuironed it rounde about. For ſo mighte they ſeme to be in the middes of the ſame Throne, and rounde about the ſame.</p>
               <p>After,<note place="margin">What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes they were.</note> what maner of beaſtes the ſame were is deſcribed dilligently, in numbre they were foure. For in times paſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the nombre was expreſſed of <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> And the partes of the worlde are trimly ſignified by the fourth nombre, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the vniuerſalitie of thinges. And ſome here haue forged the foure Monarchies of the worlde, &amp;c. And euery beaſte had his face, and his bodye, ſixe winges, and the ſame ful of eyes within, as alſo theyr bodies were ful of eyes. The firſte repreſented in ſhape and faſhion a Lion, the ſeconde a Calfe, the third a Man, &amp; the fourth a fliyng Egle. By theſe appere to be ſignified all creatures, viſible and inuiſible, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and vnreaſonable, and that the moſte excellent. For after in the .v. chapter we ſhal heare, that al creatures ioynct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together doe worſhip the Lambe, and him that ſitteth on the Throne. And verely God vſeth them all, the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres, the ayre, the fire, and briefly all liuinge thinges. And ſuche creatures as he hath choſen, to the intent to worke any thing by them, he maketh the ſame to be of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacitie, inſtructing euery one after their ſtate and condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhould want no wiſedom, reaſon, ſtrength, power, patience, labour, quickenes nor ſwiftenes. The face of man ſignifieth witte and wiſedom, as alſo the eyes ſignifie a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighte, watchefulnes, ſubtilties, and luckenes in doynge of thinges. The Lions face betokeneth force and ſtrength, and ſtoutenes or magnanimitie: As the ſighte of an oxe or a calfe betokeneth induring of labour: The Egle &amp; the ſixe winges ſwiftnes. As for an example: God choſe vnto him the Aſſiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Babilonians, whiche ſhould diſtroye Niniue. Theſe therfore, as it is in Nahum, the lord prepared and furniſſhed, that they were ſwifter than Egles, and the reſte as you may reade in the 1. and .2. <hi>Chapt. of Nahum.</hi> And ſo be al creatures miniſters of the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of his iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Throne.</p>

For they ſaie, holy lord God omnipotent, whiche was, &amp;c. Whiche wordes verely we did expounde in the firſt chapt. Who woulde not gather therof, the workes and iudgementes of him to be moſt holy &amp; iuſte? who therefore ſhall hereafter reproue the iudgementes and workes of the Lorde? Iuſte is the Lorde in al his wayes, and holy in al his workes.

In this pece is no ſmal force of this our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>And it ſhall behoue vs to way euery worde, ſynce that in euery one are greate miſteries, &amp; nothing is ſpoken in vaine. And verely that God almighty ſitteth in a Throne.<note place="margin">God ſitteth in a throne</note> And by ſitting is ſignified not only the power of iudging, rulyng &amp; gouerning: But alſo a quiet mynde (not troubled with any euill affections, after the maner of iudges of this world) and great equitie in all thinges. Secondly a booke is ſene in the right hande of hym that ſitteth, of the whiche boke we muſt ſpeake more at large.</p>
               <p>Here appereth an alluſion made, as ther is in many other places of the ſcripture, to the princes of this worlde, whiche haue bokes of the lawes, of priuileges, of inſtitutes what thing is done, and is to be done, finally of ſecretes, of actes, of condemned, and of citezens, of lyfe and of death. For ſo is both the boke and bokes aſſigned to God. Moiſes ſaith in in the .33. of <hi>Exodus.</hi> Put me out of the boke of lyfe, &amp;c. In the Pſalmes is muche mention of theſe bokes of God: In the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 56.69.139. In the ſeuenth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> bokes are opened wherof mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made alſo in the .20. of the <hi>Apocalipſe.</hi> We reade in the .3. of <hi>Malach.</hi> of a boke of remembraunce before God.

               <p>And thre thinges are chiefly ſpoken of this boke. Firſte, that it lieth not in the Throne, or in the boſome of hym that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:154393:108"/> ſitteth, or vnder the Throne, or that it hangeth before or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Throne: But it is in the right hand of God. Herby is ſignified the operation or power of God, &amp; the ſame moſte iuſt and moſte mightie.<note place="margin">The booke writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</note> For the boke is not ſene in the lefte hande. God therfore worketh, and conteineth or miniſtreth all his workes and iudgementes moſte holily. Secondly that boke is written within and without or on the back ſide. For in the prouidence and iudgementes of God, all thinges are conteined both good and euil, lucky and vnlucky, ſharpe, and ſofte, ſwete and ſewer, viſible and inuiſible, priuie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte, and all thinges in generall.</p>
               <p>Finally the boke is ſealed with ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeales. For it is moſt ſtrongly cloſed and faſtened.<note place="margin">The booke ſealed with ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeales</note> For the iudgementes &amp; works of God are firme, true, iuſt and ſuch as can not be withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

               </p>
               <p>Howebeit this lambe or ſauiour of the worlde is ſayed to ſtand in the middes of the throne, verely for that now he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth thoffice of a catholicke kinge, and prieſt &amp; gouernour, beynge alwayes ready and prepared to ſaue. So <hi>S. Stephen</hi> alſo in the .7. of the <hi>Actes</hi> ſeeth him ſtanding. Or els in other places we reade that Chriſt ſitteth on the right hande of the father. To the which this place gayne ſaieth not, conſidering that to ſitte, is bothe to reſt and to reigne.</p>
               <p>Moreouer this our Lambe appereth in the Throne of the diuine maieſtie,<note place="margin">The lamb appeareth as ſlayne.</note> as if he were killed: not for that he was not ſlayne in dede, and dead (for that ſame is a little after exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed moſte exactely) but for that he remayned not in deathe, but the thirde daye roſe agayne from the dead, to thende he mighte ſo declare him ſelfe to be the life, and reſurrection of the faythful. Or verely, for that after his humanitie he is red to be ſlayne, after his deitie to be immortall, and ſubiecte to no reproche. Wherfore in the old lawe the one of the goates in the 16. of <hi>Leuitic.</hi> is ſlayne: but the other is not killed but by the worke of a man herunto appoynted is led forthe into the deſerte. Neuertheles there is of the expoſitours, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it thus: he is ſayed as though he were ſlaine, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:154393:112"/> as after S. Chriſoſtome and S. Auſten he hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as yet the ſeares of the woundes of his death in token of his victory. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Furthermore this lambe Chriſt Ieſus our lord hath .vii.<note place="margin">The la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be hath ſeuen hornes.</note> hornes, not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in dede he carieth ſo many hornes like a goate of Iude.

It is therfore ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that Chriſt is indued with al kinde of power, diuine, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, imperial, pontifical, roiall, briefly moſte abſolute. In the 13. chapt. we ſhal heare that the beaſte hath taken to him two hornes, as it were of the lambe, whereof I ſhal ſpeake in his place. <hi>Daniel</hi> in the 7. chapt. And rule, ſayeth he, was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, and honour and kyngedome, that al nations and tounges mighte worſhip him, whoſe rule is an euerlaſtinge rule, which ſhal not periſh nor decaye at any time.

Theſe he expoundeth, and ſayeth,<note place="margin">The la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be hathe .vii. eyes.</note> whiche are the .vii. ſpirites of God, ſente into the whole worlde. I ſhewed you before, that the .vii. ſpirites are called a ſeuenfold ſpirite. Here therfore is ſignified the fulnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirite, which the lord powereth out vpon al fleſh. Here is ſignified the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal knowledge of the ſonne, in whoſe ſighte are preſent, what thinges ſo euer are done in heauen and in earth, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly &amp; priuely.

And ſeyng we nowe vnderſtande certenly, how that vnder the ſeale of faith and veritie al things are done by Chriſt, who dare hereafter more curiouſely inquire of his workes and iudgmentes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe credite and gouernement we ſhould nowe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte althinges,<note place="margin">Howe the ſonne is ſaied to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the boke at his fathers hande.</note> in caſe they were in our power? Notwithſtanding we ſhall obſerue, that the ſonne doeth not ſo receyue theſe thinges of the father, that the father is depriued therof. For in the .5. chapt. of S.

Certes the ſonne is called the worde, mouth, and arme of the father, &amp;c. or that after the humanitie the ſonne mighte ſeme leſſe than the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For very godly Aretas, where the lambe, ſayeth he, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the boke of the right hande of him that ſitteth on the Throne, it muſt be vnderſtande on the behalfe of his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: As alſo that he was ſlayne.

               <p>This deſcription of Chriſt is ſingular, moſte excellent, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry euangelicall, and ful of conſolation: and therfore is it chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be layde vp in the botome of our hartes.

               <p>For this example is verely manifolde, and euen of ſixe partes, ſuche as you ſhall hardely finde propounded in

But they nede not to praye for them ſelues, and therefore as interceſſours and Patrones they praye for their clientes and worſhippers in Earth. I aunſwer, that the Sainctes in dede praye in heauen, but that you addyng the kinde and maner of praying, do expounde it to be interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, patchyng to a piece of your owne, do forge and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet the ſame, and maliciouſly and falſely do belye it. S. Iohn here expoundeth him ſelfe, ſo that he nedeth not your patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng. For he addeth, and they ſinge a newe ſonge. Yea and he reciteth the whole fourme of this ſong, leeſte any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould corrupte that whiche he had ſayed of prayers. And that ſame fourme conteyneth prayſe and bleſſing or thankes geuyng, and not interceſſion, or inuocation. For certayne it is euen by the doctrine of the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2. and to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipp.</hi> 4. that there be two chiefe kindes of prayer: inuocation and prayſe or thankes geuyng. But the thing it ſelfe playnly proueth, that S. Iohn ſpeaketh here of the latter, and not of the firſt.<note place="margin">The ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe are expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.</note> And where as this place expoundeth certen Tipes, ſhadowes or miſteries of Gods lawe, by the ſame we maye rather confute the interceſſion of Sainctes in Heauen, for their worſhippers. For in the lawe is permitted one onlye golden Aultar of incenſe. And the ſame repreſented a figure of Chriſt. For one Chriſte is the mediatour and interceſſour betwixt God and man. It was not laweful for the people of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:154393:115"/> God, to burne incenſe, but vpon this Aultar only. It was not laweful for any man, to prepare or make for him ſelfe an odour of thoſe kinde of gumes, whereof the diuine incenſe conſiſted, and to ſmell to it: as appereth in the .30. of <hi>Exodus.</hi> Whie than doe not theſe vnderſtande, that prayers belonge to God alone, and that the Sainctes in Heauen woulde not ſmell of ſuche incenſe? <hi>Dauid</hi> in the .141. <hi>pſalm.</hi> ſayeth, let my prayer be directed as incenſe in thy ſighte, the liſtynge vp of my handes an euening ſacrifice. The Deuill deſireth to haue ſuche maner of incenſes to be made vnto him: As appereth in the .4. of <hi>Matth.</hi> and in S. Auſten of the Citie of God. But our heauenly Sainctes, are not Deuilles. Whie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonde they not that this Aultar of incenſe ſtandeth nowe in Heauen on the ryght hande of the father, and there maketh interceſſion for vs: and that for his ſake the father is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to vs, and we are accepted of God, and that by him alone we muſte offer vp our prayers vnto God, whiche are els abominable? Whie ſee they not the heauenly Sainctes at this preſent to attribute al things to the only lambe alone, and to chalenge nothyng to them ſelues? Finally that they make no mention of their worſhippers: but plainely teſtifie, that the only lambe was and is worthie, whiche ſhould take the boke, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the praiſe or thankes geuing of the heauenly ſainctes he hath called a newe ſonge,<note place="margin">What is a newe ſong.</note> whiche in the Scriptures is no newe thynge.

And becauſe the minde of manne is delighted greately with newe benefites, they ſynge a newe ſonge, whyche with a ioyefull mynde prayſe GOD, and geue him thankes with theyr inwarde affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Finallye they ſynge a newe ſonge, whiche wyth purified myndes and renewed with the Spirite doe laude GOD: whiche thynge was chiefely geuen to thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Sainctes. Whereof we learne agayne howe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth our mindes to be affected and furniſſhed in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and prayſes of GOD. This ſame, ſayeth Aretas,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:154393:116"/> I cal a new ſonge, by whoſe benefite we, whiche beyng ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in al partes of the earth, departing from the antiquitie of the lawe written, and walkynge in the newnes of life, are taught by the holy ghoſt to ſinge a geuing of thankes.</p>

Now are alſo the vertues or effectes and wonderful benefites of his death co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto vs, that eſtemyng the gouernour of his benefites done to vs, we maye beleue alſo that his gouernement ſhal be holeſome for vs, and therefore maye ſubmitte our ſelues to him willingly in faythe and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.

And they vnderſtande by the leſſe the more, to witte his whole incarnation, and the whole miſterie of our redemption, death, reſurrection and aſcenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into heauen, and the reſidewe. He therefore is the true and only mediatour of God and men, he is the only ſauiour, as he that alone was incarnate &amp; crucified for vs: he is the only gouernour, whiche by his humilitie deſerued to be exalted, <hi>Philipp.</hi> 2.

Neither muſt the godly be ſo geuen to corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thinges, that they ſhould hope for nothing aboue corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral matters. The Sainctes ſpeake here of the laſt iudgement wherin it ſhal appere to the whole world, and to al that dwel vpon the earth, that the Sainctes, which ſome time ſemed to

Nother in dede can the Aungels or Sainctes abide them ſelues to be worſhipped. Here doubtles they attribute all glory to God and to the Lambe, to God three and one, that all we ſhould doe the like. Here is alſo declared the place, wherin the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles were, about the Throne, about the beaſtes, and about the Elders. Therefore they garded al theſe places rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as it were a garde. <hi>Daniel</hi> in times paſte ſawe thinges not muche vnlike theſe in the .7. chapt.

In the .34. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Dauid ſingeth, he beyng afflicted called vpon the lorde, and the Lorde hearde him, and from all his troubles he deliuered him.

And in dede Dauid ſheweth a plaine reaſon, whie he commaundeth bodies that haue no life to prayſe God, let them praiſe, ſayeth he, the name of the lorde, whie? becauſe he commaunded, and they were created. As though he ſhould ſaie: they be his creatures, and in that they remayne yet, they haue it of him: therefore lette them make the name of God gloriouſe, as of their maker and preſeruer. And he ſignified alſo the maner of praiſing, where he addeth, he hath ordeyned them, that they ſhould indure for euer: he gaue them an ordenaunce, neither is it tranſgreſſed. As if he ſhould haue ſayed. Where they neglecte no parte of thoſe things, wherunto thei are made, but are ready in their place, order, and time, and do their duety exceadingly well, do they not preache vnto men the wonderfull wiſedome and power of God?

The voice of the beaſt is like vnto thonder. Wherby is ſignified that here is treated of greate &amp; moſt weighty matters. For moſt great and terrible thinges followe, whiche ſhake the whole world.

To him was geuen a crowne, and he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forth conqueryng, that he might ouercome. This is the viſion: the expoſition wherof is eaſie. For the Lorde ſayeth, that he will declare the deſtenies of the church.</p>
               <p>Horſes<note place="margin">Horſes.</note> of ſondry coulours are alſo brought forth of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi> in the .1. <hi>chapt.</hi> And thei ſignifie the variable courſe and ſtate of the people of Iſrael. The white coulour is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated to Innocencie,<note place="margin">The courſe of Gods worde.</note> puritie, victory, and felicitie. Therfore by the white horſe is ſignified the lucky vtteraunce of Gods word, or proſperous preaching of the Goſpel. For vpon the horſe ſitteth a horſeman, which guideth the horſe, &amp; hath a bowe. Certenly Chriſt doeth proſper the courſe of the preachyng of the Goſpell. And the .45. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> doeth attribute to the ſame ſhaftes or Arrowes.<note place="margin">A bowe.</note> For he ſtriketh his enemies far of, and bringeth them into his ſubiection. Briefly with the worde of his mouth he ſubdued to him ſelf people and nations. <hi>Eſaye</hi> in the .49. bringing in Chriſt ſpeakyng, ſayeth: And he put my mouth as a ſharpe ſword, the ſhadow of his hande coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, and he put me as a piked Arrow, he hidde me in his

               <p>To the ſame is geuen a Crowne,<note place="margin">A crowne.</note> to witte a kingdom and all power of rulyng. For Dauid propheciyng before ſayed, the Lord ſhall ſende forth the rod of his power out of Sion, to rule emonges thine enemies. Moreouer there is geuen him a crowne, that he maye crowne ſuche as ſerue him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. And it is a phraſe of ſpeakyng, and he wente forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queryng, that he might ouercome: for that whiche is, he that went forth is a conquerour, and to this ende went forth, that he mighte ouercome. For it ſignifieth that Chriſt will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce the preachyng of his worde through out the worlde, no manne beynge able to reſiſte, and euen in diſpite alſo of Hel gates. For the worde of the Lord indureth for euer.</p>
               <p>And this place teacheth,<note place="margin">That the church ſhal be alwaies and the preachinge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word.</note> that the Church ſhal be alwayes in the world, &amp; likewiſe alwayes the trueth preached, though the enemies bowelles burſte. But if we reade ouer the ſtory of the Churche, we ſhal better vnderſtande al thynges, and ſhall perceyue that this Prognoſtication hath alwayes ben moſte certayne. Chriſte was ones through the miniſterie of the worde ſhewed to the world by the Apoſtles, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proceded moſte luckely, howe muche ſome euer the moſt mightie of this worlde reſiſted the ſame. The thing is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, in caſe thoſe fiue hondreth yeres be conſidered, whiche immediately after the incarnation of our Lorde are accoumpted. In them wente forth the conquerour that he might ouercome: And ouercame in dede, the whole world receyuyng Chriſt, and worſhippyng him. Sins thoſe yeres, as before alſo, certen ſedes of errours began to be ſowen abroade. The Biſſhoppes began to contende for the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, and who ſhould be the vniuerſall head of the Church in earth: They began to reaſon of the vſe of Images in the Church, and broughte them into Churches in dede, as alſo they called the Biſſhoppe of Rome the ſupreme and generall head of the Churche in earth. And mightie Princes, and in a maner the whole ſtate of learned menne conſpired in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:154393:122"/> theſe opinions: but he hath vanquiſhed, which wente forth, that he might vanquiſh. He had in his church innumerable, whiche bowed not their knees before this Baal. A thouſand yeres after the incarnation of Chriſt, the Biſhoppes began to prophanely to pollute the lordes ſupper: and other vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed doctrines of faith: but what I praye you did they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle by ſo many counſels, determinations, and indeuours moſt erneſt? he that went forth to ouercome, hath ouercome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

At this daye alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth through out the whole worlde, howe luckely yet that white horſe goeth forwarde, which hath pearſed euen vntill our time. The Goſpel is beleued, neither can that faith be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed with any waters or fires.</p>
               <p>Thou makeſt exception, that they were heretikes whiche reſiſted the biſſhop and See of Rome in theſe .500. laſt yeres, as Bertrame, Iohn Scot ſurnamed Dunſe, Berengarius, Arnoldus Brixianus, Waldo Wicleffe, and Huſſe, Luther, and Zwinglius, and ſuch other men of the ſame ſorte, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer certen of theſe were ouercomen alſo, and put to death by the Pope. I aunſwer, that as men they might erre in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges: but in thoſe thinges wherin with the Scripture they conſente agaynſt the See of Rome, I affirme that they erred not, but ſayed the trueth. Wherupon it is certaine that Chriſt ouercame by them. What time <hi>Micheas, Helias, Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias, Amos, Ieremias</hi> and others preached by the worde of God agaynſte Idols and worſhippers of Idols, they were alſo condemned for ſeditioufe and heretikes: yea and certen of them were taken out of the waye: but was the veritie van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſſhed? Antichriſt is ſaied that he ſhuld haue good fortune, and that he ſhould puniſh &amp; afflict the ſtrong, and the people of God: but men beyng miniſters may be oppreſſed, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie neuer decayeth. S. Paull ſayeth that he is bounden for the Goſpels ſake, but the Goſpel not to be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath he ouercomen hitherto, and ſhall ouercome ſtill, which went forth that he might conquer. They ſtumble vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this conquerour as at the ſtone of offence, who ſo euer, and

For there is geuen him a great ſword. The red horſe ſignifieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate of warres,<note place="margin">Calamitie of warres.</note> ful of fire and bloud. He that ſitteth on this horſe is Mars, or rather the father of lies, I meane the Deuil, whiche was a murtherer from the beginnyng. He gathereth to him the dregges of men to make ciuile commotions, for the warres, deſtruction, firyng, ſlaughter, and deſolation. You ſee from whence the breakyng of peace is, whych God hateth. And we heare howe it is geuen him: Marke geuen, by the iuſte iudgement of God to be permitted, that troublyng al peace, he ſhould take it away, and ſet menne together by the eares, that one maye wounde and kil an other. For ſo we reade in the .1. of <hi>Iob,</hi> howe Sathan had power geuen him of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt <hi>Iob.</hi> Vnto blouddy ſoldiours is geuen a great ſword, great power to hurte, a wonderfull force of fighting: As alſo <hi>Nahum</hi> expoundeth it.

For they would not imbrace peace offered them by the preachers of the Goſpell, therfore were they worthy to be intangled with warres. The Iewes knew not the daye of Chriſtes viſitation, therfore were they
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:154393:123"/> worthely viſited of the Romanes and diſtroyed: And this thing is in the world perpetuall, that they that wil not obeye the Goſpell, muſte obeye the Captayne of the warres: they that wil not heare chriſt, muſt heare Antichriſt. Thou mayeſt not contende with God, whic he doeth this, and permitteth that. Worſhip God rather, as thou haſt ben taught in the .4. and .5. chapt.</p>
               <p>Let vs peruſe ouer ſtories, and ſee and ſuche warres be not founde, wherin men haue ſlaine themſelues with mutuall woundes, and haue killed one an other like beaſtes. If you wil reade Herodiane, Oroſius, and other good Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, you maye finde that the Romane Emperours haue ben troubled with moſte greuouſe warres, for none other cauſe, than that thei refuſed peace offered to them by the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. For none other cauſe was Rome it ſelfe at the laſt taken by the Weſtgothians, of the Eaſtgothians burnte and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. The lord had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them Chriſten Princes: but they loued more Idols. For Simmachus gouernour of the citie was ſo bolde to require a reſtitution of Idolatrie. I ſpeake nothing now of Athila, nothing of the Perſian and Affricane warres. And what time there was a wonderful ſtrife emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs the Biſſhoppes about the ſupremacie, the Saracenes ſprang vp and became mightie. After the Thouſande yere beganne the holy warre, whiche as it was moſt bloudy, ſo was it of longeſt continuance. Neuer any ſuche warre was made in al the world. Boniface the .8. inſtituted firſte the yere of Iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, a moſte wicked manne, who alſo did exhibite him ſelfe to be ſene of the people both Pope &amp; Emperour. But the ſame yere of a thouſand and three hondreth, wherin he did theſe thinges, arroſe vp in Aſia the whippe or ſcourge of God Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman, the original of themperours of Turkes which reigne at this daye. For ſo when Salomon buylded places of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, his enemies ſprang vp, which wonderfully vexed and afflicted the kingdom of Salomon. What warres are made now a dayes, and what be the cauſes of warres, al wiſe men do ſee. We wil not receaue the peaceable goſpel: It is reaſon therfore, that the Turkiſſh Armies ſhould inuade vs, that we maye both fele Antichriſt to be a ſtoute warriour, and maye al abhorre and deteſte him.</p>

For this place as it is moſt manifeſte, ſo is it ful of moſte holeſome doctrines. Firſt S. Iohn ſeeth, and ſheweth vs as it were poynting with his fingar, the ſoules, &amp; that of thoſe that were ſlaine, to wit the ſpiritual &amp; immortal ſubſtaunces, which the body beyng loſt and conſumed do remaine a liue. The body may be killed, the ſoule can not be killed. Whiche our Sauiour hath liuely expreſſed in the .10. of <hi>Matth.</hi> In the 12. of <hi>Luke,</hi> he ſayeth: be not affrayde of them which ſleye the body, and after this haue nothing that they can do more, &amp;c. Therfore tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes might wel kil the bodies of Martirs, they had no power ouer their ſoules. This place witneſſeth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, the ſoules of men not only to be immortall, but alſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or watcheful, not ſlepyng to remayne &amp; liue in Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For there be that thinke the ſoules departed from the body to ſlepe:<note place="margin">The cauſe maketh martyrs, not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> which thing is moſt vayne.</p>
               <p>Nowe alſo the cauſe is ſhewed for the which the Martirs are ſlayne: for the worde of God, and for the teſtimony that they had: they were not put to death for their wickednes or euill doynges, but for the trewe religion, wherby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:154393:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> and preached that word of God, which was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and was made fleſhe: and the Goſpell which they had committed vnto them, the teſtimony of God and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, which alſo thei miniſtred and preached. Of the word of God and teſtimony of Ieſu Chriſt I haue ſpoken in the firſt <hi>Chapt.</hi> For no other cauſe at this day are ſlaine innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of Biſſhoppes, kinges and princes. Yf they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouterers, vſurers, blaſphemers, &amp; wicked doers, they ſhuld be in ſome eſtimation: nowe where they profeſſe the onely ſonne of God, and preache the Goſpell, they are murthered without mercy. Here haue we alſo certenly defined, who be very Martirs in dede, not they that ſuffer tourmentes: but they that are tourmented for gods word. For the cauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Martir.</p>
               <p>But where are the ſoules of them that are ſlayne for the word of God ſhewed vnto vs? vnder the Aultar,<note place="margin">Where the place is of the ſoules ſlayne for gods word</note> the Aultar is after in the .8. <hi>chapt.</hi> ſet in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before the throne of God. Therfore the ſoules of al Sainctes are in Heauen, before the Throne of God, which was alſo ſignified before in the Tipe of the .xxiiii. Elders. The Lord hath ſayed alſo, where I am, there ſhalbe alſo my ſeruaunt. But the lord is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoules of the faithful, whoſe bodies haue ben ſlayne,<note place="margin">The ſouls vnder the Aultar.</note> or buried without ſlaughter, be no where els but in Heauen. Neuertheleſſe it waunteth not a ſingular miſterie, that they are layed vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Aultar, as vnder a ſhadow, through whoſe benefite the ſoules may be wel at eaſe. I told you before, and here againe repete, that the aultar ſignifieth Chriſt. For he is alſo the golden aultar, interceſſour, and propiciation for our ſinnes. For the propiciation and mediation of Chriſt we are receiued into the Ioyes celeſtial. And Chriſt is our life &amp; ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Vnder him we lie hidde, as vnder a couer or a ſhadow. Thomas of Aquine expounding this place of <hi>S. Iohn:</hi> by the aultar, ſayeth he, is ſignified Chriſt, in whom and by whome we ſhould offer to the father, what good ſo euer we doe: and through him is made acceptable, what ſo euer is pleaſaunte to God. Vnder this Aultar, namely vnder chriſt, be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoules, not only in the ſtate of life, (to witte whileſt we liue here in earth) but alſo in the ſtate of our countrie (to wit in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) as vnder him of whome they are couered, as vnder a ſhadowe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:154393:129"/> agaynſt all euill. Thus ſayeth Thomas. But I ſuppoſe that there is an other thing alſo ſignified, that martirs are made confourmable to the Aultar, that is to the paſſion of Chriſt, and therfore to reſte now vnder the Aultar Chriſt. For they that are pertakers with him in paſſion, doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate alſo with him in glory.<note place="margin">The aulter and boſom of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> For like as the boſome of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a receptacle, and that porte and hauon of Saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, into the whiche the ſoules of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are receiued, which had the faith of Abraham: ſo do we vnderſtande the aultar to be a place of bleſſednes in heauen, wherin they reſt, which with true faith haue acknowledged Chriſt the aultar, propiciation, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſatiſfaction: and haue moreouer in ſuffering offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them ſelues to God in Chriſt, through patience, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifice to God. Vnder this Aultar was gathered the firſt martyr Abel: and after as many as haue died for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſhal begathered, who ſo euer in bearing the croſſe: through tribulation enter with Chriſt into glory.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes crye vnder the Aulter.</note>Now is alſo declared what they do vnder the Aultar. The very martirs I ſaye, crye, not the beaſtes, as they haue done hitherto: and they crie out with a lowde voyce. No man ſhal Imagine, that the bleſſed ſoules in Heauen doe complayne, be ſorowfull, doe accuſe and be troubled. Theſe thinges are fayned to an other ende, to the intent we ſhould gather ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that God forgetteth not his, that he putteth not out al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement, that he ſeeth, feleth, and regardeth the iniuries and deathes of his ſeruauntes. Where the vengeaunce fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not immediately, God is thought of many to ſlepe, and to haue no reſpect vnto his. We heare therfore, that the holy Martirs crie, and that with a lowde voyce. He appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to haue alluded to that ſame in the .4. of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> The voyce of thy brothers bloud crieth vnto me, to witte for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce.<note place="margin">Crying ſinners.</note> For the Diuines call certen ſinnes criyng, as thoſe whiche are red in the Scriptures to crie vnto God, as is at this preſent the ſhedyng of bloud: the ſinne of Sodome, in the .9. of <hi>Geneſ.</hi> the oppreſſion of widowes and orphanes, in the .22. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> wages for worke deteyned, <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 24. and <hi>Iames</hi> the .5. How longe ſo euer therfore God differreth vengeaunce be it neuer ſo many yeres, yet is not the bloud
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:154393:129" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the iuſte forgotten before God. S.

In the .18. of <hi>Luke</hi> the Lord ſayeth, that the afflicted do crie bothe daye and nighte for deliueraunce. Would God they would wayegh theſe thinges, whoſe feete are ſwifte to ſhede bloud. God would not in times paſte be mercifull to his people, for that much innocent bloud was ſhed emonges them by the meane of Manaſſes theyr kinge: as appereth in the .4. boke of <hi>Kinges.</hi> Therefore dere bretherne let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wel at this daye, what we doe, and let vs not ſhede raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innocent bloud.</p>
               <p>Certenly the wordes are expreſſed of S. Iohn,<note place="margin">Whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saincts in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</note> whiche the Martirs cried to the Lorde: howe longe, ſaye they, Lord, whiche arte holy and trewe, &amp;c. They put God in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, not as ignoraunt, or inconſtaunt, but as knowyng, and moſte ſtedfaſtely mindefull of holines and trueth. For in aſmuche as the Lorde is holy, he hateth all prophane and vncleane perſones, and ſpareth them not. For as muche as he is true, he maynteyneth and defendeth his choſen, and punniſſheth and oppreſſeth his enemies as he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his worde. Sins therefore thou arte ſuche, ſaye they, O God, why doeſt thou not iudge, and aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge our bloud, of them which in earth, as in their kingdome exerciſe tiranny, and oppreſſe euery good man? Al this ſignifieth none other thing, than that God for his owne ſake, whiche is holy and true, will neuer forget the iniuries of his ſeruauntes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we vnderſtande theſe thinges to be ſpoken by a figure called Proſopopeia: that is the fayning of a perſone: not that the Sainctes in Heauen do expoſtulate with God, but that we by ſuche a figure might vnderſtande that God hath care of Martirs, becauſe he is holy and true. S. Auſten in the .68. queſtion vpon the newe Teſtamente: Seynge the Lorde, ſayeth he, hath taught vs to praye for our enemies, what is the cauſe that the ſoules of thoſe that are ſlayne crye out as doeth the bloud of Abell, and require that they maye be auenged? And he maketh aunſwer: Sainctes be not impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that they ſhould vrge that thing to be done now, which they know ſhal come to paſſe in the time prefixed, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be preuented, nor yet delayed: but by this ſaying he

Thus ſayeth he. And this in dede ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the playneſt ſenſe of al others, eſpecially if we conſider the things that follow in the lordes au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer, and it was ſayed vnto them that they ſhould reſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Primaſius Biſhop of Vtica expoundyng this place of S.

For it is not lawful, to thinke that they woulde couet any thinge agaynſt the pleaſure of God, ſins their deſires depende vpon his wil, &amp;c. And S.

Aretas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth here alſo out of the commentaries of S. Andrew biſhop of Ceſaria: moreouer the Sainctes appere hereby to wiſſhe for the ende of the worlde.

Which thing is more fully declared by this that followeth.</p>
               <p>For by the ſame that followeth ſuch au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer was made to the complaincte of Martirs,<note place="margin">What was aunſwered to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce.</note> that we may vnderſtand what is the ſtate &amp; glory of ſainctes in heauen, which haue offered their bodies for the Teſtament of God: and that God hath not forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bloud ſpilte: but that he wil at length requite thoſe bloud ſheders when he ſeeth time. But where he hath reſerued this time to him ſelf, when he wil rewarde the bloud ſuckers, it is not our parte to inquire curiouſely therof: but rather to be in a readines, that if he will that we alſo ſhould ſuffer for the Teſtimony of Ieſus Chriſt, we ſhould runne ſpedely and cherely through afflictions vnto glory doubting nothing, but that we ſhall be ioyned to the bleſſed Martirs, in heauen, and that the iuſte iudge in that daye wil render to al the enemies ol God, the Churche, and Gods worde, after their demerites. And albeit the time of perſecution doe ſeme a world to the fleſh: yet is it here, and els where in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures called ſhorte.<note place="margin">The ſtate of ſoules in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is moſte hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</note> But theſe thinges muſte be ſene and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by partes.</p>
               <p>Firſt doubtles the ſtate of ſoules in heauen is in al things moſt fortunate. The which is figured by the white garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For the glory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſed is ſignified, that are nowe in light,

Nother is there any other thing ſayed here in the ſixt ſeale, as alſo in the fiue fourmer ſeales, than that which was prophecied before of the ſame our lord Ieſus Chriſt in the .24. of <hi>Matth.</hi> that the Goſpell ſhould be preached through out the world: and how there ſhould come warres, famines, peſtilences, &amp; perſecutions moſt greuouſe: and falſe prophetes, whiche ſhould diſceaue men, whom alſo they ſhould drowne in moſte greuouſe ſorrowes.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe theſe thinges muſt religiouſely be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For it is not to be thought,<note place="margin">Chryſte is not author of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corrupt doctrine.</note> for that the lambe openeth the ſixte ſeale, and the Sonne by and by waxeth blacke, that Chriſt is authour of the corrupte &amp; euill doctrine.

For Chriſte teacheth ſownde doctrine by the Apoſtles and ſincere preachers: which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſemeth vile to the world and can not pleaſe, of his iuſte iudgement he leaueth the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to their affections, and as the Apoſtle S.

And the ſeducing through corrupte doctrine, is a more hurteful euill, than are the blouddy perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. Yea and the ſeducers and falſe prophetes haue done more hurte to the churche, than haue cruell tirauntes. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally men are more greuouſely puniſhed what time they are relinquiſſhed to be ſeduced of diſceauers, than when they are obiected to be torne in pecs of their murtherers. Therfore is it a moſt greuouſe plague of god, and vtterly to be abhorred, for the ſimple veritie diſpiſed, to be deliuered to liyng diſcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, which after the demerites maye, with reuerence be it ſpoken, al to be ſhite, and be piſſe thee. For where the goſpell is purely preached vnto many, theſe men ſaye, I vnderſtand not what theſe men teache vs out of the Goſpell: but this I can ſee that the olde haue all to be rayde vs, and theſe newe bothe to be piſſe and beſhite vs. Therefore ſhalt thou haue teachers, which ſhal perfourme to thee in dede the ſame that

The church ſet vpon the rocke, is not vnſtable: but by reaſon of the variable fortune, is ſubiecte to moſte diuerſe chaunces. For now the churche triumpheth, ſtreight wayes beyng oppreſſed ſhe mourneth: nowe ſhe increaſeth in nombre, by and by ſhe is diminiſhed. And the church is lighted of Chriſt.

When they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that the monaſtical life, and their merites, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ſtande before God, they flee from the face of God: and tourmented with the prickes of their conſcience knowe not what they maye do, whither they maye tourne them, where is the true

Therfore we iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rightly to be moſt bleſſed, whiche through Chriſt acknowledge the father as a father: and through Chriſt haue acceſſe to the father, as fauouryng them &amp; louing them: acknoweledging verely in the feare of God their ſinnes, but yet with a trewe faith hoping for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, knowyng that they are through Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God the father. The monaſtical, heremiticall, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfactoriouſe, &amp; phariſaical faction acknowledgeth fully this doctrine, therefore are they tourmented with ſorrowes that can not be vttered. If ſpeake not here of the monaſteries or Monkes of this our time, in whome we ſee almoſt no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience at al, nor other intent, than to be addicte to Idlenes, voluptuouſnes, and to beare rule. In times paſt were found men ful of conſcience, entring into celles and woods, for non other cauſe, than that they might ſo be ſaued. Of ſuche ſpake the Lord in the goſpel: when they ſhall ſaye, ſayeth he, Chriſt is in the wildernes, goe not forth, &amp;c. And I doubte not, but that ſome ſimple alſo at this day for this intent take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the monaſtical life: but they ſhall finde alſo, the ſame that S.

               <p>Furthermore this place might ſeme that it ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the tokens which go before the laſt iudgement,<note place="margin">The place is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of the laſte iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> and of the terrour of the wicked: of whom the Lord preached in maner to the ſame effect in the .21. of <hi>Luke.</hi> But of the laſte iudgement ſhal be ſpoken more at large, and in his place in the .11. and .19. <hi>Chapter.</hi> of this boke and els where.

For this boke of Apocalipſe is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful Euangelical, moſt ful not only of prophecies, but alſo of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, exhortations, and moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable conſolations.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What winde is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note>Firſt is to be expounded, that whiche is ſpoken of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreinte of the windes by the Aungels, that they ſhould not blowe. Winde as alſo leaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſcriptures, is vſed both in good and euil parte. For winde is called vaine and falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and an hope conceyued of erroneouſe doctrine: As in <hi>Oſee</hi> the .12. and the .5. and .22. of <hi>Ieremie.</hi> So is leauen called the Phariſaicall doctrine, and hipocriſie ſpringyng thereof. <hi>S.

And the holy ghoſt is ſhaddowed by winde in the .3. <hi>chapt.</hi> of <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> And in the 2. <hi>chapt.</hi> of the <hi>Actes.</hi> Winde is ſubtile, it pearſeth, is felte, and is not ſene: greate is the force thereof, it doeth refrigerate, it drieth, gathereth clowdes, whiche rayne and make the earth fertile. Full rightly therfore by winde is ſignified the ſpirite of God, and the ſounde doctrine, whiche is of the ſpirite of God. Therfore is it one winde, the ſpirit of God whiche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpireth: and there be foure windes, that is to witte many by the corners of Heauen and partes of the earth, that is to wit preachers diſperſed through out the whole world. Therfore the doctrine of the Goſpell inſpired from all partes of the world bloweth, or is preached: ſo that ther be many windes, yet all procedyng of one. For there is one and the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, whiche ſpeaketh by the miniſters, and geueth them ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry graces .1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. Briefly, by the blaſte of windes we vnderſtand the free preachyng taken out of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng of gods word is prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>Secondely we muſte knowe that there be both good and euil Aungels in the Scriptures.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:154393:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> euil of the euil Aungell. And the enemie of the trueth ſtireth vp men in al places of the world, in the Courtes of Kinges, in the places of Iudgement, in Scholes, in Colledges, in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Townes and Villages, whiche may let the free courſe of Gods worde. Therefore the proclamations of Kinges and Biſſhoppes flye to and froe, are proclamed and ſet vp, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the readyng of the Bible, the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, &amp;c. And to the intent to haue ſome pretence of their euill doyng, they forge that the Bible is corrupte in a thouſande places, &amp; that hereſie is learned and taught out of the ſame. Therefore alſo they prohibite and condemne the Bible and the bokes of the Goſpell, of the vnworthines of the whiche thing it can not worthely enough be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the church. They do the ſame that in times paſte <hi>Antiochus, Epiphanes, Diocleſian,</hi> and other men of the ſame ſorte are red to haue done. The expoſitours of the Bible in times paſte deſerued excedyng great prayſe: nother was there any faythfull that ſayed the holy boke to be corrupted, for that al tranſlations agreed not emonges themſelues. We liue therefore at this daye in a time moſt corrupt and moſt vnthankefull.</p>
               <p>And the reſtrainte of reading holy Scripture, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the corrupte doctrine, and of intanglyng the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and of diſpayre that followeth on the ſame. And by the Earth he vnderſtandeth men dwellyng in Earth: by the Sea and Iles, men of Ilandes, and that dwell on the Sea: by trees, men ſhadowed euery where in the Scripture by trees. For vnleſſe the windes blowe, the trees floriſhe not, neyther the earth waxeth grene. The Prophet ſayeth, ſende forth thy ſpirite, and they ſhal be created, and thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe the face of the earth. And excepte the worde of God be preached, the mindes of men waxe not grene, nother are the fruictes of good workes brought forth of men. And therfore the Aungelles prohibiting winde, are ſayed to hurt: as in dede there is nothing more peſtilent nor perniciouſe, than the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of the free preachyng of Gods worde.

And others, whiche haue ſpent a great parte of their life of a good zeale, doubtles, but not accordyng to knowledge, in thoſe trifles and ſuperſtitions, when they are comen to the ende of their life, they diſpiſe al together: yea and freely profeſſing the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, they condemne al thoſe trifles, and committe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues wholy to the chriſtian faith, eſtemyng nothing more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or ſurer, than the rule of fayth, which alſo they couet to heare recited to them as a trewe confeſſion, &amp; die in the ſame.

They ſuppoſe therfore, yea and contende alſo, that thee muſt a certayne or prefixed time remaine, wherin al theſe thinges may be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The ſecond to beginne at the comming of our Sauiour, and procede vnto Antichriſt, and to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, which in dede the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes haue moſte diligently deſcribed, and wherin they teſtifie many thinges to be accompliſſhed: And that the thirde time ſhould beginne from the goſpel reſtored, and the laſt iudgment, and continewe foreuermore: whiche reſtitution verely ſemeth to be of al other moſt perfit &amp; complete, wherin God wil geue vnto man moſt fully, what things ſo euer he hath promiſed by the mouthes of the prophetes and Apoſtles. Hereof hath S. Peter moſt manifeſtly made mention in the actes the .3. chapt. ſaying: it behoueth Chriſt to take heauen, vntil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of reſtoring of al things, which god hath ſpoken by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of al his ſainctes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time of the prophetes.

               <p>Or happely we may on this wiſe diuide this matter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auenture more plainely: the reſtoring of Iſrael, or of al faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is verely either corporall, or ſpiritual. The corporal maye be called hiſtoricall, and was perfourmed by <hi>Cyrus, Zoroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, Iehoſua, Ezras, Nehemias</hi> and the <hi>Machabeis:</hi> And the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the lorde is of two ſortes: the firſte in dede is in the fleſh, in the which we beleue many things, the Apoſtles bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witnes, to haue ben fulfilled of Chriſte: in the latter he ſhal come agayne from Heauen into iudgement. In that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng he ſhal moſt fully accompliſſhe, ſuch thinges as we ſee as yet not perfourmed. And doubtles al our hope is herunto referred, and comforted by this comyng. Thoſe thinges that are ſpoken of the Apoſtle in the .11. to the <hi>Romains</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of the Iewes, are fulfilled partly, and partely are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled dayly, and as yet ſhal be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Now we retourne to the plenty of them that ſhalbe ſaued and are already ſaued from the middes of the kingdome of Antichriſt, to be declared.<note place="margin">Many thouſands of Iewes be ſaued.</note> S. Iohn diuideth the vniuerſalitie of man kinde into Iewes and gentiles. Of the Iewes are raccompted an hondreth and fourtie and foure thouſande. And after our iudgement, of a thouſand Iewes there ſemeth ſcarſely one or two to be ſaued: but where by the teſtimony of our ſauiour him ſelfe, ſo great a numbre is ſaued: there is lefte verely, of this numbre certayne, an infinite multitude of this ſtifnecked people to be gathered which ſhal be ſaued. And they are not ſaued by the Lawe, or by circumciſion, or by their damnable obſtinacie: but vp the grace of God in Chriſt their Meſſias, the only redemer, reuealed to them of God mercifully, and of them receyued faithfully. For if the thefe on the croſſe mighte be ſaued, nowe leauinge his lyfe, what ſhal lette, innumerable Iewes to be ſaued by the ſame meane? neuertheleſſe I will here determine no meaſure.

Item, let vs do good whileſt we haue time: the time will come, when we can not worke. The parable of ten virgins declareth vnto vs the ſame.

Firſt he ſayeth, howe they ſtande before the Throne, and in the ſighte of the lambe. For the firſte felicitie in the bleſſed life, is to ſee God as he is, and to inioye his glory, to be with Chriſte in glory. <hi>Iohn</hi> .17.1. <hi>Iohn</hi> .3. white ſtoles are the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of triumphant and cleane perſones. As herafter ſhal be declared more at large, and hath ben noted ones or twiſe before. It betokeneth that the bleſſed ſoules are decked with light, &amp;c. And the Palme alſo is a token of victory.<note place="margin">The palme</note> Plinie treateth much of the Palme in the .4. <hi>Chapt.</hi> of the .13. booke. Al men write that the Palme was the moſte auncient badge of a conquerour.

               </p>
               <p>Vnto al theſe thinges is annexed an exceding great noiſe, wherby not only they geue God thankes, and prayſe his

                  </gap> is rather, as alſo Eraſmus hath noted. For they ſignifie that God is not bleſſed in him ſelf only, but to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated this ſaluation vnto them, and ſaued them. Of the Throne or ſeate of God was ſpoken before in the .4. chapt. God the father him ſelfe ſitteth on the ſeate.

               <p>Agayne they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate this ſaluation to the lambe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that is to Chriſt. For God by his grace through Chriſte ſaueth the beleuers. And where as Chriſt is called the lamb, the whole miſterie of the incarnation and redemption is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the word Lambe, that beyng in dede reconciled to God by the bloud of the hoſte,<note place="margin">Iohn .6.

For bycauſe, ſaye they, they know no better things: and the workes that they doe, they doe them of a good intente, therfore are they ſaued by the ſame. That is moſte vayne and moſte vngodly. They adde, vnleſſe we ſhuld iudge thus, doubtles there ſhould not one of the Papiſtes be ſaued. Certenly I ſaye playnely, that no man is ſaued by papiſtrie, no more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Mahometrie. For it is called the waye of perdition euen of S. Peter him ſelfe.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> Howebeit I thinke not therfore, that no man of the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The latter ſuppoſeth, that euery manne in euery and what ſo euer his religion be, ſhall be ſaued. Agaynſte theſe the

There is non other name geuen to men, wherin they muſt be ſaued, but that of Chriſt Ieſus. None other waye is open into heauen, nor any other dore: he that affirmeth any other, is called of the veritie a thiefe and a murtherer.

Than is there an other tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, which arriſeth of the feare of God, and is a care of obteyning ſaluation. This is ſory for the vnrightuouſenes and corruption of man. It is ſory for the greuouſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Antichriſt. And theſe alſo, albeit they be not made Martirs, yet are thei in an other life clothed with white.

Where verely bloud ſpringled whiteth not, but polluteth. Therfore muſt we vnderſtande theſe thinges ſpiritually, to witte that the very, natural and humane bloud of Chriſt, ſhed ones on the Croſſe, beyng ſprincled vpon vs ſpiritually (as <hi>S.

Finally we perceyue how thoſe whiche are ſaued from the kingdome of Antichriſt, are ſaued by the merite of Chriſt alone, &amp; by none other thing, as I haue alſo ſhewed you before. Morouer by and by is inferred: therfore be they in the ſight of gods ſeate.

               <p>Firſt ſtand the Saincts before the Throne of God. In the Throne is the maieſtie of god to be worſhipped for euer and the bleſſed Trinitie. And the Sainctes ſtand before the ſeate, not as thei are wounte that tary before the gates.

And this ioye ſhall be euerlaſtyng and perpetuall: which is ſignified by daie and night. Otherwiſe in the bleſſe euerlaſting there is no mighte at all, nor anye chaungeable courſe of time.

We reade in the .1. <hi>chapter of Iob.</hi> The ſonnes of God came, and ſtoode before the Lord, and Sathan came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo into the middes of them. The bleſſed Aungelles are called the children or ſonnes of God.

For he vſeth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of Aungels, like Aungels: and ſo the ſeruice of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, as Deuils in dede. But where as the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th numbre is the numbre of fulnes, conteyning in it ſelf al times: for there be ſeuen dayes of creation and reſt, there be ſeuen worldes or ages: certenly ſeuen Aungelles appere before God, for that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:154393:150"/> they betoken all battels that ſhall be foughten to the ende of the world.</p>
               <p>For to theſe ſeuen Aungels are geuen ſeuen trompettes, and the Aungels already had the trompettes, and euen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themſelues to blowe the on ſet.<note place="margin">The vſe of trompets.</note> Where chiefly the vſe of trompettes is to be ſearched for. The ſame is moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſcribed of Moſes, in the .10. of Nombres. The vſe of trompettes was diuerſe, as it is alſo at this daie. Firſt by the ſounde of the trompet the people of Iſrael were called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to conſult of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth. Agayne at the ſounde of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Senate of princes of the people did aſſemble. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer they were warned by the trompet, when &amp; who ſhould remoue their tentes. Furthermore the trompets blewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to battel, what time they ioyned to fight, as maye be ſene in the .20. of <hi>Deuter.</hi> The people moreouer were called together with trompettes on the holy dayes to publicke and diuine ſeruice. Sounde with the trompet in <hi>Zion,</hi> call the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſayeth <hi>Iohel,</hi> gather the people. There was more ouer a feaſte of trompettes, and a Iubiley, hauing the name of the blowyng and ſounde of trompets: as appereth in the .25. of <hi>Leuit.</hi> Finally the preachyng of the veritie was figured by the ſounde of trompettes, neyther might any other blow the ſame but prieſtes. For it forceth much to whom you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte or deliuer the ſignes publicke.</p>
               <p>Of this ſundry vſe of trompettes, none ſhall agree better to our mater, than the warlicke. For this world hath a ſhape of warre. In it are the campes of good men, and the campes of euill: the tentes of Catholickes, and tentes of heretickes. The chiefrayne of theſe is Sathan, and of thoſe Chriſte: the Captaine and Emperour of theſe is the Deuill, of the other the ſonne of God. And now the Aungels ſounde their trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes, and blowe the onſet: not that the good Aungels and God him ſelfe is the Authour of hereſies and of heretickes, whoſe original is referred to Sathan and ſinne: but ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their trompettes they geue in dede warnyng to all men, and ſignifie that moſt greuouſe warres ſhal arriſe in the worlde, and euen in the church it ſelfe. But diuerſe men are diuerſely moued and worke in warre accordyng to their natures. The trewe catholikes beyng warned by the trompet, take heade
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:154393:151"/> to themſelues, praye, and finally taking in hande ſpirituall weapons, prepare themſelues vnto battel and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fully fight for Chriſt, and for maynteinyng and defending the veritie. Heretickes, ſectaries, and menne of corrupte mindes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to theyr mallice, takyng to them alſo Armour, runne ſorth and fighte agaynſt Chriſt and the veritie, defende lies, and ſuch as be weakelynges they take, ſpoyle, beate downe and diſtroye. The good ſhepardes, are the trompets of God and of Chriſt: the Deuill bloweth vp Archeheretickes and beginners of ſectes.</p>
               <p>Of the good, and of their fight, we ſhal heare in the .11. and in the <hi>chapt.</hi> following. Neuertheles in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict we muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the ſainctes ſlepe not, nor be any where idle, but to doe their duetie euery where. It was nowe in dede e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the lord to ſhewe vs the heretikes &amp; ſectaries ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp; to declare, how much they maye hurt, that we might watche more dilligently, and beware of all corruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſte trompet or fight.</note>The firſt Aungel ſoundyng the firſt trompet, denounceth vnto vs the firſt conflict. All and ſingular battels haue ſome thing like, and diuerſe. It is like, in that all hereſies doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne Chriſt, and would haue the trueth of the Goſpell, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extinguiſſhed, or wraſted out of the true ſenſe. And that ſame is ſingular or diuerſe, that at an other time, Sathan aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayling other doctrines, hath ſpred abroade in the Churche ſundry hereſies. Therefore whileſt the Aungell ſoundeth the trompet, that is to ſaye proclaymeth warre, he warneth the Sainctes to watche. Therfore as he is yet blowing, through Gods permiſſion, accordyng to his iuſte iudgement, by the meane and ſuggeſtion of Sathan, ther was made hayle and fyre mixed with bloud, the whiche beyng ſo tempered, was ſente or fell vpon the Earth. For S. Paule acknowledgeth ſpiritual policies in the heauenly ſpirites. And the Scripture in a certen place doeth figure rightwell, the ſounde and hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine by the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly dewe and ſhowre that maketh the earth fruictefull: moſt rightly therfore S. Iohn co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pareth the falſe and hereticall doctrine to hayle.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful fruicte of the earth. Wherfore like as els where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe doctrine is called darnell, leuen, chaffe, &amp;c. ſo is it here
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:154393:151"/> called haile. But this hayle is tempered, and of a wonderful mixture. For it hath fire and bloud ioyned with it. Theſe thinges muſte be expounded after an allegorie, not after the letter. Haile is water congeled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> colde.<note place="margin">Hayle is corrupte doctrine.</note> And water they haue called the wiſedom of the ſcripture: haile therfore ſhal be falſe wiſedom. Yet fire is put vnto it. The pretenſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures and inſpiration of the holy ghoſt, wherunto is added bloud, the euil affection of man, to witte the vice of Ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wrath, contention, hatred and like affections. Of theſe is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an haylie doctrine, hurtfull doubtleſſe and peſtilent. For when falſe doctrine ruleth or depraueth the Scriptures, and wicked affections of teachers are ioyned with all, a peſtilent doctrine arriſeth. Such was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginnyng the doctrine of the <hi>Nazareans,</hi> or <hi>Mimeorites,</hi> and of the <hi>Hebionites,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that iuſtification came not by the only faithe of Chriſt, but by the law. Our men fought ſharpely, to wit S. Paule &amp; thother Apoſtles, againſt this perniciouſe doctrine. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning many corrupt with Philoſophie,<note place="margin">Diuinitie corrupt by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie.</note> others blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with mens traditions, haue brought forth moſt corrupt opinions. Hiſtories beare witnes herof. And Tertulliane not without cauſe called Philoſophers the patriarches of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes. For S.

               <p>And haue verely hurte the church very much. For the .iii. part of trees was burnt, and alſo al grene graſſe. This nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre is intimated in foure tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pets, and in fixe likewiſe. And it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſignifie, that a greate parte of men inconſtaunte and vnſtable are ſeduced &amp; lofte, geuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be diſtroyed of wicked men: agayne, the beſt part of the ſaythful to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The lord him ſelf knoweth the numbre exactely. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for vs to know theſe thinges which he hath reuealed vnto vs, nother to ſearche curiouſely any further.</p>
               <p>That men are ſignified by trees,<note place="margin">Trees.</note> appereth by the .9. <hi>chapt.</hi> where it is ſayed, &amp; they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, that they ſhuld not hurte the graſſe of the earth, nother any tree, ſauing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, whiche are not &amp;c.

Vnder the name of this ſmoke infernal, are conteyned the opinions, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrine, that the Biſhop of Rome, as he is the prelate of the chiefe churche and Sea Apoſtolicke, ſo to be paſtour v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal and Apoſtolical: and morouer the head of the church militaunt, the vicar of Chriſt in earth: whoſe voyce muſte be hearde aſwel, as Chriſtes him ſelf: that he hath full power in the church, the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, &amp;c. And the reſte of the like ſorte. That the ſame ordeyneth and geueth to al churches Biſſhops or Paſtours, which ſhould gouerne al other churches after the preſcripte of the church of Rome. &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:154393:165"/> For the Macedonians of the weſt, were gouernours of the world, and after them the Romanes: and theſe moſt mightie nations, whiche we nowe named ſerued them.

               <p>And at the beginning and alſo in the times that followed, the matters of Mahomet increaſed exceadingly.

And the Saracenes expulſed out of thoſe parties, came into Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke: from thence ſayling into Sicilie and other Ilandes, they poſſeſſed Spaine alſo: and ouer rode other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nere, and inuaded Italy, ſpoiling Rome, and conſuming with fire many goodly buildynges. Concerning the which matter ye may reade <hi>Volaterane</hi> in the .12. boke of <hi>Geograph.</hi> in the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde Arabie. About the yere of our lord .M.CCC. the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhe emperours had theyr beginning of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe at this daye a great parte of Aſia, Affricke and Europe.

               <p>Now are painted out alſo the horſemen and horſes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ride,<note place="margin">Horſmen, Horſes.</note> that is to witte the maners and power of the Mahometanes are deſcribed. The Horſemen had on haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, not of yron, but firie of yelow and brimſtony colour. Therfore fire, <hi>Hiacinth</hi> and ſulphur, were in ſtead of the breſt plate, theyr Armure. For the <hi>Hiacinth</hi> he putteth by and by ſmoke. For <hi>Hiacinth</hi> in colour reſembleth ſmoke nexte vnto fire &amp; flame. And the horſes had Lions heades, &amp; Serpentes tailes with heades. The horſes breathed out of their mouths
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:154393:167"/> fire, ſmoke, &amp; ſulphur. With theſe plagues, ſayeth he, to wit fire, ſmoke, &amp; brimſtone, the thirde parte of men were ſlayne. Thei did hurt alſo me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine tailes. He addeth, theyr power was in their mouth, hurt in the tayle.

For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mahometanes by their wicked doctrine, which is aptly compared to fire diſtroiyng, to ſmoke blinding, and to ſtinking ſulphure, haue diſtroyed innumerable. Finally with a lioniſh or tirannical force they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreyned many people to receyue theyr Alcorane: and moreouer what time their falſe prophetes ſeme to flatter (for <hi>Eſaye</hi> ſayeth, a falſe prophet is a taile) they playe the ſerpente, and infecte menne with the moſte corrupte poyſon of doctrine. Out of their mouthes procede not only blaſphemous lawes, but alſo mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uelouſe prayſes, greate boaſtinges of victories, abominable blaſphemies. Where ſaye they, is your chriſten faith? our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Mahomet ouero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth al. Al your things are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

And in dede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mahometanes reigne in a maner euery where, in victories &amp; riches they are fortunate &amp; noble. That thing maketh the Chriſtians affraide, &amp; cauſeth many to reuolte. For what is done emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs vs, is to manifeſt to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Therefore the holdyng vp of bothe handes doeth ſignifie a moſt perfit fidelitie, and moſte aſſured confirmation of the thing ſworne. Certenly in the holy ſcriptures the lifting vp of the hande is oftener than ones put for an othe. Whereof perauenture we Germanes haue borrowed, where we ſay, that is to ſaye, thou ſhalt confirme me this by an othe. And in matters moſt ſeriouſe and graue we are wont to vſe ſome outwarde ceremonie, wherby we maye make the wordes and the thing it ſelf as it were more notable &amp; graue.

When bargayne or contracte is made with wordes, the right handes are ioyned together alſo, in token of fidelitie. Therefore when we take a ſolemne othe, we lifte vp our hand towarde heauen, where we beleue that the Lord ſheweth him ſelf gloriouſe to the faithful: from whom we fele that al good thinges come vnto vs: from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we perceiue alſo that vengeaunce doeth fall vpon the periured, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of God.

The life alſo of the gentiles is ſhamefull and filthie: they are geuen to voluptuouſenes, ful of ſurfetting, addicte to filthie luſte, they ſtinke in whoredome, and excede in gorgeouſe apparel and pamperyng of the body.

Herunto I ſuppoſe belongeth that ſaiyng of <hi>Daniel:</hi> and when they ſhal fal, they were holpen with ſmal ayde, &amp;c.

It is iudged therfore a full teſtimony, whiche ſhall be confirmed with the agreable declaration of two. Where therfore the lord ſayeth that he wil geue two Prophetes, it is aſmuch to ſaye, as that he wil geue ſo many miniſters as ſhal ſuffice, which ſhal both builde vp his church and alſo plucke downe and re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a ſonder the kingdome of Antichriſt.

               <p>The Apoſtles and Apoſtolicall men are called witneſſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where in the Goſpel, and in the .1.<note place="margin">Who be witneſſes.</note> chapt. of the Actes of Apoſtles. Witneſſes are ordeyned in iudgement that they ſhould faithfully vtter that whiche they haue ſene or hearde, that they ſhould forge nothing of themſelues, &amp; to the things that ſhould be teſtified ſhould nother adde or put any thing, nor take awaye any thing. So likewiſe are placed of God in the church of God, the witneſſes of God, that is to ſaye mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: and of them is required, that they Imagine nothing of their owne braine, nother put to nor take away any thing from Gods worde, but ſimply declare to the church of God the thinges they haue ſene in the ſtory of the Goſpell and hearde of the prophetes and Apoſtles. Therfore are thei falſe witneſſes, nother worthie to be called the witneſſes of God and of Chriſt, which bryng not the Goſpell. They be rather the Popes witneſſes, whoſe decrees &amp; decretalles they bring forth, and beare witnes of them to the foliſh people. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhal thoſe two prophetes be witneſſes of Chriſt, and ſhal bryng witnes for Chriſt out of the moſt trewe Scriptures.</p>
               <p>And the beginnyng of them is here referred to God and

For though the function of the miniſterie be neuer ſo harde and daungerouſe: yet ſo ſhal God comforte and confirme them, that they maye appere a fewe dayes only, not monethes or yeres to ſuffer perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to trauel in this laboriouſe worke of the Lord. And where I haue ſayed that thoſe nombred dayes are put for an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentie of time, this hath moued me, that by and by in the .12. chapt. the ſame nombre of dayes ſhall be aſſigned: for the which yet he hath ſet before, for a time, and times, and halfe a time. Whiche appereth playnely to be taken out of the .7. and .12. chapt. of <hi>Daniel.</hi> I knowe that the ſame is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of many for three yeres and a halfe: that the time, ſhould ſignifie a yere: times, two yeres: and halfe a time, half a yere. But euery manne maye perceyue that the thing it ſelfe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaunt to that nombre of yeres, if he be at the leeſte any thing ſene in ſtories. In the .7. of <hi>Daniel.</hi> the other beaſtes, ſayeth he, gaue ouer their rule, and ſpaces of life were graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:154393:187"/> for a time, and a time. But who will expounde theſe thinges of two yeres only: ſins it is euident, that the <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Perſians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> reigned many yeres? he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth therfore that thoſe kingdomes ſhould reigne ſo long, as God would permitte them, and geue them power to reigne. We ſaye in Dutche where yet we appoynt no time prefixed. In the ſame chapt. of <hi>Daniel</hi> is put the ſame phraſe of ſpeache, that the Sainctes ſhal be deliuered into the hande of Antichriſte, for a tyme, tymes, and halfe a tyme. And in the .12. chapt. he ſayeth that his Prophecie ſhal be fulfilled in a time, times, and halfe a time. But who ſhall beleue that within three yeres and an halfe all thoſe thinges ſhoulde be accompliſſhed, which he declared in the whole worke? Whie than doe they reſtrayne the times of Antichriſt to three yeres and an halfe, eſpecially his perſecution? whie ſee they not the deſtruction of Antichriſt, and the peace of Sainctes, and the daye of iudgement, to be the ſame daye? For <hi>Daniel</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the beaſte ſhould be caſte downe hedlong into Hell, when the ſeates be furniſſhed. And Paul ſayeth, whome he ſhal deſtroye with his comyng, and who ſhall ſhewe vnto vs the certayne daye of iudgement? It is knowen to the father alone. Lette them leaue therefore with their ſupputations to ſtriue with the Goſpell. It appereth therefore that the Lord by that kinde of ſpeakyng as it were by a riddle, to haue dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined no tyme certayne: but rather to haue admoniſſhed the godly of longe ſufferyng, of patience and conſtancie: and to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that we ſhould not ouer curiouſely ſearche the inſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this time, but ſhould rather permitte it to chriſt him ſelfe, in an other place ſaiynge: It belongeth not to you to knowe times, and the momentes of times, whiche the father hath reſerued in his owne power: but watche, that when the Lorde ſhall come, he maye finde you watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng. Therefore whether ſo euer the Lorde ſhall differre his iudgement a longe, ſhorte, or meane tyme, be you conſtaunt. So at this preſent he ſayeth, howe the miniſters of Chriſte ſhal preach al that tyme, wherein Antichriſt ſhal perſecute. And verely if thou reade the ſtories, thou ſhalt finde, that the moſt vertuouſe &amp; beſt learned men, haue in all ages, now for the ſpace of theſe ſeuen hondred yeres and more, conſtantly

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:154393:189"/> to this our buſines. For like as <hi>Helias</hi> through, the power of God, did prohibite, that it ſhuld not raine: ſo ſhal the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the goſpel fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diſobedient, or ſuch as wil not heare the word, but had rather be ſeduced with popiſh abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhut vp heauen it ſelf, that is ſhall aſſuredly teſtifie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is ſhut of God, for aſmuch as through Chriſt alone, as the only gate y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> waie is opened vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom they not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding do conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne: &amp; ſhal tel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo ſharpely, that the grace of God is denied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is only grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by Chriſt. For the prophetes are authours, that raine doeth ſignifie the grace of god, &amp; fruictful watering ſent downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen. Therfore al the time of their prophecie thei ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly teſtifie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei are through their greateſt deſerte, &amp; their own faulte depriued of that celeſtiall grace, light &amp; life, ſo many as had rather haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes dragges than the true bread from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>Secondly he alludeth to the ſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; ſayeth,<note place="margin">thei tourne waters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bloud.</note> that power is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to theſe prophets to tourne waters into blod: which diſcordeth nothing with the fourmer me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre. For the water of godly wiſedome, is a figure of the grace and reliefe of the ſpirite. Bloud betokeneth offence and punniſſhment. For that ſentence of the lawe and of thapoſtle is wel knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: your bloud be vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your owne head. Therfore ſhal theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes teſtifie, that God hath verely ſent his worde of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſaue al beleuers, but that this ſhal be to the vnbeleuers through their owne faulte vnto condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For they that heare the preachyng of Gods word, and beleue it not, heare it to their owne conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ſo is the goſpel at this daie preached to many with out fruicte: as beyng corrupted with the popiſh doctrine, by force wil not be wiſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Finally they haue power to ſtrike the Earth with euery plague, ſo ofte as they wil. But they will not,<note place="margin">they ſtrike the Earth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> plagues.</note> excepte Gods worde, by the whiche they beyng inſpired and inſtructed are gouerned, ſhall commaunde them. For they wil do nothing
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:154393:190"/> wilfully, they will not followe their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but the worde of God. Howebeit they are ſaide to ſtrike the earth with pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, when out of Gods word thei threaten, that God with plagues wil punniſh the ſinnes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thoſe plagues are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the .26. &amp; .28. of <hi>Deuter.</hi> Wherfore in caſe they threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to impenitent perſons warre, peſtilence famine, ſickeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and other calamities, God will ſende them to ſuch as are vncurable, as the lord ſayeth oft him ſelfe in <hi>Ieremie.</hi> Agayne and on the contrary parte they ſhal in riche with all bleſſyng thoſe that obeye gods word, what time they ſhal ſhewe forth the Lordes bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Thus muche hath he ſpoken hitherto concernyng the preachers of the Goſpel, which ſhal fight agaynſt Antichriſt, in that laſt age before the iudgement, and ſhal buylde vp the church, &amp; confirme the beleuers.

All theſe thinges ſhall be better vnderſtande by the Hiſtories of later times, and of ſuche thinges as are done yet at this daye. And to the intente, that omittyng the eldeſte thinges, I maye touche thoſe of latter time: the Biſſhoppes of Rome had thought they had wonne the fielde in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Conſtaunce, when they had burned <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prage:</hi> but within a ſhorte time after many godly and wel learned men ſprange vp in <hi>Boheme</hi> and in other cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in whom thoſe ſlayne appered to haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe the ſpirite of life.

I ſaied e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen now, that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat was in dede particular, but to haue a general fight annexed. For Michael fighteth whiche is as captaine of this warre: and Michaelles Angelles fight alſo:<note place="margin">Who fight.</note> which muſt be wel diſcerned, although that Michaell &amp; his Angels make but one parte only. On the other ſide fighteth the drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as emperour of this warre, &amp; his angels fight alſo. And theſe verely make non other partes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue heard before in the beginning of this chapt. That the partie of this fight were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church &amp; the deuil. Neuertheles leeſt the victory ſhould be attributed to the church, &amp; not rather to Chriſt, the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt now be omitted, and Michael brought in figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:154393:208"/> Whereupon there is in theſe thinges ſome difficultie: but it ſhal be eaſie enough for him, that will marke euery thing in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Who is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Michaell captaine of the warre againſt the Dragon.</note>Firſt we muſt ſee, what that Michael is, &amp; there is in dede no doubte, but that the Angel Michell appered in the viſion, with an Army of Angels fighting. And that on the contrary parte againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fought the Dragon with an hoſte of deuils. But for aſmuch as we hearde in the beginning, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe were tokens, they muſt nedes ſignifie &amp; betoken other thinges. I ſuppoſe here therefore to be ſignified, Chriſt the head of his church, king &amp; protectour, with his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres, Apoſtles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs &amp; faithful. Nother is it a rare thing, that Chriſt ſhould be figured to vs by Angels: but is euen moſte accuſtomed, that Angelles are called the ambaſſadours of God, &amp; the faithful ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Ieſus Chriſt. Chriſt therfore head of the church &amp; the faithfull membres of Chriſt, fight againſt the Dragon, yet after a diuerſe ſort. For chriſt ouercame him alone in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat with out helpe of any creature, whileſt in temptations he diſcomfited him at the laſt, &amp; alſo by diyng on the croſſe, &amp; riſing agayne from the dead,<note place="margin">How chriſt hath fought w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> he al to brake his head. This is the only, trewe &amp; ſingular victory: wherby afterwardes are obteyned the victories of Chriſtes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres, goten of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral fight, wherein Chriſt fighteth not now only hande to hande with the Deuill, but all the membres of Chriſte at all times vnder Chriſt their Captayne fight againſt the Deuill, and in the vertue or victory of Chriſt, fight and ouercome: as we ſhal heare by and by in the ſonge of prayſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael is Chriſt.</note>But for great and ſondry cauſes we affirme Chriſte to be figured and ſignified to vs vnder the tipe of Michaell. We know by the ſcriptures as many of vs as be learned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael, as alſo Gabriel, be the names of good Angels of god. Michael ſignifieth, who as God? And who I praye you is ſuch, as God, but in whome thexpreſſe Image of the fathers ſubſtaunce, &amp; which is the Image inuiſible, and worde of the father from the beginnyng, I meane the very ſonne of God Ieſus Chriſt? Michael in the .10. &amp; .12. chapt. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, protectour &amp; Patrone of the Iewiſh nation. And it is plaine, that the people of Iſrael had from the beginning non other tutour and patrone, but Meſſias him ſelfe, the bleſſed
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:154393:208"/> ſede. This appereth in the .7. of <hi>Eſaye,</hi> were we reade, that the lord ſpared the people of Iuda, and the princelicke Citie for Chriſt. In an other place he ſayeth moſte openly, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende that citie for my ſelfe, and for my ſeruaunt Dauid. And Dauid is called Chriſt, in the .34. of <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> Chriſt is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in very dede gouernour of his people, whiche neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in defendyng and deliueryng his, vſeth the miniſterie of Angelles: who alſo attribute nothing to themſelues, but all glory to God alone. Morouer that excellent victory, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not with out offence of godlines be aſcribed to Michael the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changel. For ſo omitting our Meſſias Chriſt, we ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende Angels being made &amp; worthie to be called Angelical, rather than Chriſtians. In the lawe was written, the ſede of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal breake the ſerpentes head. But the lord neuer toke the nature of an Angel, but the ſede of Abraham, and by ſinne hath condemned ſinne. There ſhal followe anone in the ſonge. Now is ſaluation and power, &amp;c. And there is added: for the Deuil is caſt out. And this ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath Chriſt alone accompliſſhed, wherfore it is neceſſary, that Chriſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour of Sathan be ſignified by Michael.</p>
               <p>And the Dragon fought hande to hande agaynſt the lord,<note place="margin">The drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels fight.</note> not only matched with him in the deſerte, but alſo neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to tempte and aſſayle him, ſo longe as he liued here on earth: he ſtired vp alſo agaynſt him the Phariſeis &amp; Princes of the people, kinges and the Romane gouernour, and ſo at the laſte brake the lordes heele. This was the greateſt fight of the Dragon. The ſame Dragon inſpireth now kinges and Princes, wicked Prieſtes and cruel men, his Angelles which maye warre vpon the churche. And all theſe verely do perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and vexe the churche in the power of the red Dragon.

               <p>Now is alſo declared with what lucke they fought<note place="margin">with what lucke they ſought.</note> on ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide: to witte moſt luckely concernyng Chriſt, moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckely as touchyng the Deuill or red Dragon.

For herof al godly may
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:154393:209"/> learne that Sathan our enemie is vnarmed: and that Chriſt in this conflict is on our ſyde, as our Emperour &amp; captayne at all tymes, by whome all the godly maie eaſely in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictes ouercome.

And the naturall order is here altered, which treateth nothyng of the ſucceſſe of the battaile, til he hath ſet forth al the conflicte before. But this battaile ſhall be continewed hereafter in the reſte of the 12. and all the .13. chapter.</p>

                  </gap>, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled not, they had no ſtrength.

But the Lorde ſayth in the goſpel.<note place="margin">Ihon .14 Math. 16</note> The Prince of this world came, and againſt me he hath nothing. Again in the goſpel: The gates of Hell ſhall not preuayle againg her, the rocke I meane, and ſecondly againſte the church. Although therfore the Deuyl make an horrible vprore, and cruelly rage againſt Chriſt and his church, yet is he without force. For the vertue of Chriſte preuayleth.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde parte is, nother was theyr place any more founde in heauen, which maner of ſpeach ſignifieth no other thing, than that the reprobate Angell is put from al dignitie, glory &amp; power: moreouer that he hath no more any place in the church, or emonges the electe of God: not that the deuil ſhould not retourne, or ſhould not tempte, or renewe warre, but becauſe he hath no place parmanent. Herunto appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that the Lord ſo ofte repeateth in the Goſpel, and now the Prince of this worlde is caſte oute, in the .12.14. and .16. chapters of Sainct Ihon. Moreouer, by other places of the Scripture it is manifeſte, that the Deuyll is ſhut out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And it ſhall be eaſie for vs to ſhutte him oute, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt out by the ſonne of God, hath no place in vs, vnleſſe we our ſelues geue place to him. Which we ſhoulde not do,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:154393:209"/> the Lord admoniſheth vs dilligently, that we ſhould watch. The ſtory is knowen in the .12. of <hi>Matth.</hi> of the Deuill, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to retourne, and therfore toke vnto him ſeuen worſe ſpirites. But wherefore doeſt thou heare him, whie doeſt thou obeye him, whome thou ſeeſt ſhut out of Heauen? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that herby is ſignified alſo, that the Deuil was ſo fully vanquiſhed of Chriſt, that he was alſo driuen to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the place of the battayle.</p>
               <p>For the thirde membre,<note place="margin">Sathan caſt downe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth.</note> as it were expoundyng the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde addeth: and he was caſte to the Earth.

Howbeit he was ones moſt valeauntly throwen to the Earth. Of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, in the miſterie of our redemption, and in the vertue of the ſame is dayly caſt to the Earth, of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And like as the Deuill hath no place permanent in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen nor in the choſen: ſo verely doeth he inhabite all earthly, that is to ſaye menne ſauouring the earth, and contemnyng heauenly thinges. Yea and we heare that his Angels are caſt out with him. For the Lord in the goſpel of S. Iohn the .16. chapt. ſayeth: In the world you haue afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but be of good there, I haue ouercome the worlde. And S.

               <p>And by the waye he expoundeth,<note place="margin">The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the deuil is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by certen wordes.</note> what we ſhoulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande by the dragon, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath ſpoken hitherto, to wit the olde enemie of man kinde.

Firſte he calleth him the olde Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. For at the beginnyng by the Serpent he infected with the poyſon of death and ſinne our firſt Parentes, and by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole vniuerſal world: as is to be ſene in the .3. of <hi>Geneſ.</hi> and the .5. to the <hi>Romains.</hi> Therfore I ſayed in the beginning of this chapt. that he is called a Dragon.

               <p>Thirdly he calleth him Sathanas, in the Hebrewe word, to witte an aduerſarie, for that he is in al things againſt god, and obiecteth him ſelfe and reſiſteth men in holy matters, yf happely he might hinder or corrupte them. Laſte he is called <gap reason="foreign">

For all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and hereſies, al deceiptes, and all leaſinges, finally all kinde of euils, haue flowed out of this moſt filthy welſpring And who is he that heareth theſe thinges, which wil not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre that vile beaſt? they muſt nedes be ſtarke madde, that ſeke by al meanes to be in fauour with that wicked ſpirite.</p>
               <p>He ſhould now here conſequently annexe the reſidewe of this fight, to witte how the Dragon perſecuteth &amp; aſſaulteth the woman, and ſhe agayne by fliyng reſiſteth, and ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth through Chriſt. But he ſuſpendeth the ſame narration yet a little while,<note place="margin">A ſonge of victory.</note> &amp; placeth now a ſonge of victory, and triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe of ſainctes in heauen, of the Angelles and bleſſed ſoules. The ſome wherof is, that Chriſt hath ouercomen, &amp; that the faithful do ouercome in Chriſt: and therfore muſte heauens themſelues, and al that dwel therin, reioyce and ſinge. And I repete that theſe things are interlaſed in the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian and Romiſh ſight, for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation, leeſt the ſaincts ſhould in thoſe great daungers by reaſon of their natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie be diſcouraged: but callyng vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of Chriſt, ſhould fight manfully, when they vnderſtande vnder whoſe banner they fight, and with whome they fight: verely wyth one ouercomen vnder Chriſtes ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dart. And when we heare that the Dragons force is broken, we ſhal thinke that the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of eyther beaſt, aſwell the ten horned as the two horned, are weakened in the faith of chriſt. This geueth alſo no ſmal courage in this conflicte, that we ſee that the Dragon hath no power ouer them that are ſprinkled and purified with the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:154393:210"/> bloud of Chriſt, but ouer earthly and worldly men. And this triumphe is heauenly. For voices are hearde out of heauen, ſingyng a mery note, to the intent that the reioycing of the bleſſed ſpirites might haue more authoritie, grace, and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie emonges the pore afflicted.</p>
               <p>Thei al with one voice ſinge merely, that ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; power is now made perfit, for by the Lordes death and reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Perfit ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by Chriſt.</note> God hath wrought power, and made perfit the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the fathers, to witte whileſt he trode downe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes head, aboliſſhed ſinne &amp; death, and reſtored life. Thus is the kingedome of God in this worlde eſtabliſſhed in the electe, whileſt euen by the power of Chriſt the Prince of this worlde is caſte out and ouercome. For the cauſe followeth, wherfore we muſt ſo reioyce, and what vertue and power of Chriſt hath ſhewed it ſelfe, or howe ſaluation is made perfit: becauſe, ſayeth he, through Chriſt, the Deuill is caſt downe, that is to ſaye ouercome and va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſſhed, that he can no more accuſe mankinde before the iudgement ſeate of God. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belongeth that S. Paule wrote.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Who ſhall accuſe the electe of God? It is God that iuſtifieth, who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth? It is Chriſt, whiche died, yea whiche roſe agayne, which is alſo on the right hande of God which maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for vs.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the heauenly dwellers do not only preach the victory of Chriſt, but of all the faythfull,<note place="margin">Chriſt hath made alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull victours.</note> which they obteyne agaynſt Sathan in the fayth of Ieſu Chriſt: that it maye her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at the leeſt appere, what we ſhould vnderſtande before by Michael, and by his Angelles. And he beateth in dilligently, that Chriſtians ouercome not Sathan by their owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, force, or ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, but by the merite and grace of Chriſte. And they ſayeth he, to witte the Angelles of Michael, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Dragon by the bloud of the Lambe. For in aſmuch as the faythful are purified by the bloud of Chriſte, Sathan hath nothing againſt them: but ſins they haue the ſpirite and fayth of Chriſt, they ouercome the Deuill alſo. So in times paſte the diſtroyer had no power ouer thoſe houſes, whiche were marked with the bloud of the Lambe: <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And he addeth an other thinge, for the which the faithful ouercame: for the worde of the teſtimony of Chriſt, which is the goſpel.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:154393:211"/> Which becauſe it is inuincible &amp; eternal, they ouercome all thinges of this worlde, who ſo euer abide in the liuely and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal word of the veritie. And euen in the goſpel moſt trewe the lorde himſelfe hath promiſed that he wil not forſake his, and wil fight for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore muſt the faithful nedes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. To theſe thinges is added more the effecte of Chriſtes purifiyng. They loued not their life more than Chriſte: and therfore haue thei geuen it for Chriſt vnto death, and ſo haue ouercomen. For many are vanquiſſhed by this one thing, that they wil not haſarde their life for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For theſe great benefites of God they exhorte nowe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens themſelues, and all the inhabiters of Heauen, that is to ſaye they exhorte one an other, to ſinge a ioyeful ſonge. And that which the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſainctes ſaye they do here, they teach the ſainctes in Earth to doe alſo, and inſtructe, of what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and ſorte they ought to be, which ſhal ouercome Sathan in battaile, to witte purified by the bloud of Chriſt, cleauing to the teſtimonie of Ieſu Chriſte, and contemners of their own life, to whom it ſemeth not greuouſe to dye for Chriſtes ſake.</p>

               <p>But in whome the Deuill poſſeſſeth his kingdome, in the ſame alſo he vttereth his mallice againſt the elect, &amp; that his great mallice. For he rageth moſt cruelly againſt the godly, and againſt godlines. He rageth alſo moſt extremely againſt thoſe his worſhippers, whom he polluteth with all kinde of filthines, and with al ſhame and reproche defileth.</p>
               <p>Agayne I ſuppoſe that ſame to apperteyne to the comfort of the godly, that is ſpoken of a ſhorte time. For Sathan in dede through Antichriſt ſhall moſte cruelly rage agaynſt the church, but thoſe dayes ſhalbe ſhortened for the electes ſake.

Therefore the Romane Empire could not by plainer markes be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. To this Empire alſo <hi>Daniel</hi> attributed ten hornes, aſwel for that it was collected of many kingedomes, as alſo that it was diſparſed agayne into many. Wherof ſhal be ſpoken in the .17. chapt. And it is a comon thing to the Scriptures, by hornes to ſignifie kingedomes and power.</p>

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:154393:216"/> that ſame ſhall be founde manifeſte in this Empire, and chiefely in the heades. For yf ye beholde the hilles of Rome, chiefly the Mounte Capitoline, ye ſhall finde it called of <hi>Cicero,</hi> the manſion place of the Gods, verely for that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in a maner the Images of all the Goddes. For on thoſe hilles were ſene the Temples of Iupiter after all his properties, &amp;c. The Temples of Saturne, Iuno, Minerua, of Mars the reuenger, of Hercules, Ianus, Venus, Apollo: alſo the Temples of Fortune, Helth, Victory, concorde, and ſuche other. But yf ye loke vpon the Princes themſelues, <hi>Caius</hi> woulde haue his Images ſette vp in Temples, and the people to ſweare by his name. <hi>Nero</hi> blaſphemed the name of Chriſte, and by ſheddyng of innocent bloud ſought to aboliſſh the Goſpell. <hi>Domitian</hi> commaunded him ſelfe to be called God and the Lorde.

In the 7. chapt. of <hi>Daniel.</hi> By the eatte of the Mountayne is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the monarchie of Grece or Macedome, by the Beare the Perſian, and by the Lion the monarchie of the Chaldeis or Babilonians.

Which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moch in effecte, as if he had ſayed: the Deuill reigned whole in the Romaines, and the Romaines wrought by the Deuyl, all that they did. For the Deuyll is the originall of murthers and lyes. Of the deuyls ſeate I haue ſpoken in the ſeconde chapter of this booke. Howebeit we muſte knowe, that all power is of God: but he by his iuſt iudgement doth permit many things to the Deuil ouer the children of miſbeleif. For <hi>S.

When he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the moſt mightie workyng of Sathan, by tokens and kyng wonders, wherewyth they ſhoulde be deceaued, that wolde not receaue the truth, he addeth immedately: therfore God ſhall ſende them ſtrong illuſions, that they may beleue lyes, and be iudged all that beleued not the veritie, &amp;c. For (as I haue ofte admoneſhed) we muſt take good hede, that we mixe not the workes of God and the Deuyll together. Good workes are of God, euil are of the Deuyll. Now leeſt any man ſhulde maruayle, why God permitteth ſo moch to the Romains and the deuil their head, and doth not infringe theyr force for the electe ſake, S.

For he ſeeth one of thoſe heads, as it were wounded to death. For <hi>Nero</hi> which firſt of the Emperours, ſtirred vp the firſt perſecution againſt the church, with his owne hand ſticked himſelf. And he was the laſt Emperour of that fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. And left the Empire ſo afflicted, that it was lyke enough to haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to decaie.

                  <note place="margin">Of the power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rom. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note>The Apoſtle by the reuelation of Chriſte ſpeaketh alſo of the power &amp; maieſtie of the Romane Empire. The Romane Empire was in dede of greateſt power in the time of <hi>Octaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Auguſtus,</hi> alſo in the time of <hi>Domitian</hi> his empire, and in the reigne of <hi>Traiane,</hi> alſo vnder <hi>Hadrian, Aureliane, Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> The greater parte of the worlde inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted obeied therunto, as al Europe in a maner, Aſia &amp; Africke: as both latin and Greke hiſtories do teſtifie. Howbeit herof the lord warneth vs, that we ſhould not curiouſely ſearch the counſelles of God, beyng inquiſitiue, whie God gaue ſo great power to the Romanes, whom he knewe would abuſe the ſame to the oppreſſion of Chriſtes Church? for where he ſaieth, that the power was geuen to Rome, he ſtilleth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſeth all murmuringes. For Empires be of God. But he is moſt wiſe, rightuouſe, and holy. Where therfore he made the kingdomes of the world ſubiecte to Rome, he did it wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, iuſtely, and holily. In that the Romanes corrupte Gods ordenaunce, and committe themſelues to be gouerned of the Deuill, it cometh of euill.</p>
               <p>Let our diſputations here ceaſe, for the wiſe man ſayeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that wicked men and hipochrites reigne for the ſinnes of the people. And that he reherſeth kinreddes, to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he doeth after the imitation of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> which by ſuch a phraſe of ſpeach is wonte to ſignifie a moſte large and puiſſaunt Empire.</p>
               <p>But what apperteyneth this to vs, or what profit (ſayeſt thou) cometh to vs herby, that the Romane Empire is ſo far extended through out the worlde? This verely, we ſee howe this prophecie hath hitte euery thing rightly that wente be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: therefore is there lefte no place to doubte of the thinges
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:154393:220"/> that followe. Let vs conſider moreouer that moſte puiſſaunt kingdomes, which ſeme to men inuincible, maye of God be diſolued without any difficultie: lette vs therefore learne to feare God, and to walke in his commaundementes, and to diſpiſe theſe earthly thinges.</p>
               <p>Now alſo he declareth more expreſſely, who ſhall worſhip the beaſt:<note place="margin">Who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe the beaſte.</note> for he ſayed, that men in the world ſhould be taken with admiration of the beaſte, and ſhal worſhip the beaſt: he now declareth the ſame, and ſo placeth the word of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that he maye vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de it as wel of thoſe that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as alſo to come. For he ſpeaketh not only of men of his time, but of al, which rauiſhed with the admiration of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and maieſtie thereof, ſhal eyther denye or contemne the fayth of Chriſt. And he ſayeth, that al ſhal worſhip the beaſte that dwell vpon Earth: and leeſte any man ſhould referre it abſolutely vnto al, as though non of the trewe worſhippers of God ſhoulde be any, he annexeth, whoſe names are not written in the boke of life of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be, to wit the reprobates, not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> choſen: the vnbeleuers. I ſay, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne the word of the goſpel, diſdaigne to heare it, and be rebelles to Chriſt. <hi>Aretas</hi> the expoſitour. they dwell vpon the earth, ſayeth he, which are moued with no care of heauenly things, nor of the glory that there is: or geue themſelues to earthly habitation, and applie themſelues to a beaſtly life according to the ſame. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> bringeth alſo a teſtimony out of the .17. of <hi>Ieremie.</hi> They that departe from me, ſhall be written in the Earth. For they haue forſaken the veyne of liuely waters, euen the lord him ſelfe. Of the boke of life I haue ſpoken in the .3. and .5. chapt. and wil ſpeake of the ſame in the .19. and 20. chapt. of the Apocalipſe.</p>
               <p>Hereunto he annexeth a notable thing after the maner of Apoſtles, which are alwayes wonte, ſo ofte as they haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to celebrate and intimate Chriſt, and the miſterie of his redemption. S. Iohn therefore ſayeth, howe the lambe hath ben killed and offered vp from the beginnyng of the world. And it is with out controuerſie,<note place="margin">The lambe ſlayne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world.</note> that by the lambe is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is therefore demaunded, howe he was ſlaine from the beginning of the world. Many here tourmente themſelues
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:154393:221"/> at the length they expounde, that Chriſt was ſlaine in <hi>Abel,</hi> and in all ſainctes, by perticipation not by paſſion. Certenly we maye not expounde this place after the lettre. For Chriſt coulde not be ſlayne, before he was borne. Moreouer the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle affirmeth, that Chriſt ſins the beginning of the world, hath not ben ſlaine oftener than ones. Reade what he ſayeth in the .9. chapt. to the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> And yet can not the moſt and trewe worde of God be contrary or repugnaunt to it ſelfe. Therefore ſaye we after the comon rule of expoundyng the Scriptures, that the ſignes haue the names of the thinges ſignified. For the Lambe was called a paſſouer or paſſyng by, wherof it was a ſigne. Circumciſion was called the leage or conuenaunt it ſelfe, ſacrifices are named ſinnes. So vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the beginnyng of the worlde ſacrifices were ſlayne, whiche were ſimbolles or ſignes of Chriſte to be incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and offered vp ones for the clenſyng of ſinnes. We vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande therfore by this teſtimony of Chriſte, that all the ſacrifices of the auncient fathers, were ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Chriſt, and that the redemption of Chriſte hath from the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the worlde ben of efficacitie to all the faythful. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this place is notable and worthie to be obſerued. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to apperteyneth the Apoſtles teſtimony in the .1. to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> the .10. That al our forefathers haue eaten of the ſame ſpirituall meate wyth vs, and dronken of the ſame drynke, and that they dranke of the rocke followyng them, whiche was Chriſt.</p>

Verely it was to men a wonder, and ſemed vncredible, that ſo great a Maieſtie coulde falle: but yet it falleth. The fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full marueled alſo what ſhoulde be the ende of blaſphemies, ſlaughters, iniuries, abominations. Moreouer the doctrine that followeth, is notable, excellent, and worthie to be kepte in memory. Therefore he ſtireth vp all men to attentiuenes,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:154393:221"/> and than he ſayeth: whoſoeuer ſhall leade into captiuitie, ſhall go into captiuitie: whoſoeuer ſtriketh with the ſworde, &amp;c. For in ſuch ſort he declareth the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome and the Romane empire, that he confirmeth with al the iuſtice of gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And alſo with a maruelouſe breuitie of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſentence, geuen or pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced againſt Rome, he ſuppeth of that vnmeaſurable power. And this is both by the law of God, by the law of nature, and by the law of al natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as a thing moſt iuſt, that euery man ſhulde loke to haue the ſame done to him, that he doth to an other. For to this be longeth the ſentence reherſed of <hi>Noe</hi> in the .9. of <hi>Gen.</hi> He that ſhedeth bloud, his bloud ſhalbe ſhed. The ſame is repeted in the .33. of <hi>Eſay.</hi> Wo to the that ſpoileſt, ſhalt not thou be ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? A teſtimonie wherof is <hi>Niniue</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet <hi>Nahum,</hi> and Babilon with al the prophets. Therfore hath the Lorde taught in the goſpell, whatſoeuer ye wold that men ſhuld do to you, do you the ſame vnto them alſo. With what meſure you meat vnto others, with the ſame ſhall others meat vnto you agayne. Whoſoeuer ſtryketh with the ſworde, with the ſword ſhall periſh. Therefore it is moſte reaſonable, that ſins Rome hath ſpoiled the whole world, and iniuried al nations, and made cruel war vpon al men: it ſhuld be againe of al na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions inuaded, ſpoyled, torne, and troden vnder foote. Let vs marke this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, &amp; let vs fear god, and do good vnto men. For here is ſentence geuen againſt al men that do iniurie to their neighbours, but eſpecialli thoſe which inuade innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with vniuſt wars, &amp; which thei be hired to make &amp;c.</p>

The Niceyue counſell confyrmed that ſame cuſtome, and woulde haue it ratified. <hi>Socrates</hi> in his eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorie the .5. boke the .8. chapt. reciteth many Metropolitane churches in <hi>Aſia.</hi> S. <hi>Hierome</hi> to <hi>Euagrius,</hi> and in an epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> ſayeth playnely, that in oulde tyme churches were gouerned by the common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of prieſtes or elders, and that time Byſhops and prieſtes were all one: After by the cuſtome of the church, not of the veritie of the Lordes ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (I rehearce Saincte <hi>Hieromes</hi> wordes) Byſhops were preferred before prieſtes, yet muſte they gouerne churches together.</p>
               <p>And of that ſame cuſtome,<note place="margin">Howe the Biſſhop of rome came to his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie.</note> yea rather of the abuſe of the cuſtome, Antichriſt had his beginning. For <hi>Boniface</hi> Biſhop of Rome began fyrſte to take vppon him dominion ouer the churches of Affricke. But he was immediatelye repreſſed by the ſixte Affricane cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, where at Sainte <hi>Auſten</hi> is red alſo to haue bene: After that, began alſo the Byſhop of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople to chalenge to himſelfe the Supremacie, for this cauſe chiefelie, that Conſtantinople was than the courtelyke Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and chiefe Citie of the Empyre. Howe beit here certen Byſhoppes ded reſiſte him: emonges whome was <hi>Leo,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of ould Rome. There remayne certen Epiſtles of his
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:154393:224"/> to the Emperour of Conſtantinople, to the Byſhops of the Eaſte, and to others. So was this trouble for that tyme alſo appeaſed. But ſtreight way an other Byſhop of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople blynded wyth Ambition, requyred a freſh, to haue the ſupremacie geuen hym. Whome <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of Rome wythſtood: And this later ſo impugned the ſupremacie of the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, that he ſticked not to call him the vauntcurrour of Antichriſt, which woulde vſurpe the tytle of generall byſhop. There remayne not a fewe epiſtles wrytten of this matter, in his regiſter.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe a fewe yeares after, when the Byſhoppes of Rome were ſore affrayde, leeſte that dignitie ſhulde be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the byſhoppes of Conſtantinople, <hi>Boniface</hi> the .3. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned of themperour <hi>Phocas</hi> a parricide, that he which was biſhop of old Rome, might be taken for the vniuerſal biſhop, and Rome for the head of al churches: which conſtitution ſet vp the Pope in Authoritie,<note place="margin">Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note> that he was nowe, taken of the moſte parte of the weſt Biſhops for Apoſtolicall, and manie matters brought before him to determine: whereby he got the fauour of many Princes, chieflie of Fraunce, by whoſe ayde he droue oute of Italie both the Emperour of Grece, and kinges of Lumbardie, and brought Rome, and the beſte &amp; moſt floriſhing partes of Italie vnder his own ſubiection.

For Chriſt kepeth ſtil both the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſthod and kingdome with the faithful in the church: nother doeth he reſigne the ſame to any other, he hath appointed no Vycar. For he executeth continuallie at the righte hande of the Father, the offices both of King and Biſhoppe, and this all faithfull fele with ioye. He ſayeth therefore, lyke a lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes. For the Pope wyll make all men beleue, that he hath receiued of Chriſt Prieſthod, and Empire, that he is Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Vycar: wher he is nothyng leſſe.

               <p>He procedeth to ſhewe moreouer,<note place="margin">He ſpake as the Dragon.</note> what the talke of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſte is, what is his doctryne, and what is his ſpeach.

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:154393:225"/> Antichryſte or Popery, Diabolicall doctrine, or a deuyllyſh mouth or toungue. We muſte ſee therefore, howe the deuyll ſpeaketh: that we may ſo vnderſtande rightlie, howe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſte ſpeaketh. In <hi>Paradiſe</hi> he ſo tempereth his talke, that he calleth in doubte the certentie and veritie of Gods word, and by that occaſion placeth his owne worde, in ſteade of the worde of God.

And after the ſame ſorte Antichriſte in his Poperie bringeth the veritie of the Scripture in doubte, which by all meanes poſſible he diſfameth as vnperfecte, maymed, obſcure, and doubtefull. And by and by vpon that occaſion, he bringeth in his traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; decrees, wherewith he maye patch vp that, which he contendeth to want in the Scriptures. But in his traditions he affirmeth thinges contrary to Gods worde and ſo diſcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth men. And all men knowe, that haue any ſkill of popyſh matters, that the fyrſte and chiefe principle and foundation of Papiſtrie is, that the Scriptures are vnperfecte and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and therefore to haue nede of traditions. Moreouer the Dragon ſpeaketh openlie againſt the lawes of God: and ſo doeth the Pope manifeſtelye. God wyll be worſhypped alone: the Pope addeth to him Sainctes. God forbyddeth Idolles and Idolatrie: the pope co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth them playne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. God wyll haue his name to be ſanctified, and his name to be ſworne by onely: the Pope by diſpenſing with othes, polluteth the name of the Lorde, and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vs to ſweare by the names of Gods. God commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vs to kepe holie the Sabboth daye: The Pope bringeth this in contempte, ſetteth forth his owne holy daies, and maketh double feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. God commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vs to honor our parents: This doeth the Pope abbrogate, and commaundeth to make more of Abbotes and Abbeſſes.

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:154393:225"/> to ſpeake in the meane time of nothing els more filthie. And where God forbiddeth lies, and falſe witnes: the Pope, and his whole doctrine (which he ſetteth forth beſides the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is ſowed of lies: and not only he diſpenſeth with falſe witneſſes, but permitteth alſo to breake ſafe conduites and publicke fayth geuen, and yf he hate the Prince, abſolueth the ſubiectes from the othe of their fidelitie and obedience: geueth libertie to al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiſcences, and maketh lawes, which nurriſſhe the deſires of the fleſſhe. And whiche ſhall be the Dragons mouth, yf this be not it?<note place="margin">Math. 4.</note> The Dragon moreouer is red to haue ſpoken and ſayed to the Lorde: all theſe thinges will I geue thee (for he ſhewed him the kingedomes of the worlde) yf thou wilt falle downe and worſhippe me. What other thing ſpeaketh the Pope? doeth he not inriche his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children with the Riches of this worlde, eſpecially ſuch as will fall downe and kiſſe his fete? I ſuppoſe the Deuill would neuer be ſo ſhameles, as to offer to the Lorde his fote to kiſſe: but that beaſte in the ſighte of God and his Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles, and of al the world, dare put out his fote, marked (not with out a great mockery) with the ſigne of the Croſſe, and profer it to be kiſſed of all the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Romane Emperours ſuppoſed all kyngedomes and prouinces to be theirs, and to appertayne vnto them: ſo do the Biſhops of Rome make their boaſte that all realmes are theirs.

There came forth lately a boke printed at Lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, of <hi>Auguſtinus Steu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> keper of the Popes librarie, in the which he reciteth out of the regiſter of one <hi>Gregory</hi> (I ſuppoſe the .7.) all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Europe, Spayne, Englande, Fraunce, Denmarke, Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary. &amp;c.</hi> The proprietie whereof apperteyneth to that ſeate of Rome, the vſe vnto the Princes, Clientes of the ſame ſee. Ful ofte haue the Popes aſſayed to bring into ſubiection to them and to their Sea the kingdomes of the Eaſte alſo, and that vnder pretence of the holy warre, and recoueryng the Lordes ſepulchre. And like as the olde Romanes vexed with continuall warre the nations that did not acknoweledge or obeye the olde Romane Egles: ſo the See of Rome in our time, and in the memory of our forefathers hath put to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and trouble, thoſe kingedomes, and nations and people, that went aboute to reuolte, and would not acknoweldge thoſe double keyes, that is to ſaye two hornes.

Which doubtles we ſee fulfilled in the Popiſſhe kyngedome two wayes. For firſte the Papiſtes haue procured, ſuch authoritie and reuerence to the Romane Empire, which they cal both ſacred &amp; holy, that as many as liue at this day, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heare but the name of the Romane Empire ſpoken of, doe Imagine a certen diuine thinge, and brought vnto them from Heauen. I graunt, that there haue ben many right noble Princes, godly, and al praiſe worthie, in that ſame Empire: as was Conſtaunt, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> wyth ſome of his ſonnes, <hi>Gratiane, Valentinian, Theodoſe,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe others.

For I tolde you before, that the firſte beaſte was worſhipped, in this that ſely menne receyued the Romanes religion, and worſhipped Idolles. The heythen did verely confeſſe the high God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie. but thei ioyned to him many Goddes, vnto whom they ſubmitted elementes, diſeaſes, Artes, countries, cities,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:154393:227"/> the membres and partes of man, and ſuch other like things. <hi>Aeolus</hi> was God of the windes, and <hi>Neptune</hi> of the Sea, <hi>Pluto</hi> ruled in Earth, <hi>Mars</hi> was God of warre, <hi>Minerua</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> of artes, <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> ouer diſeaſes, <hi>Hercules</hi> and many moe. <hi>Venus</hi> was lady of Loue, and the Goddeſſe <hi>Iuno</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Nother was there any membre in the body, that had not his God: ſo had all Countries and Cities theyr ſauyng goddes, and euery houſe their domeſtical Goddes. To them afterwarde they framed Idolles, that is tokens and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialles, whiche might bryng thoſe heauenly goddes into the memorie of the Earthly dwellers. They builded for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles and churches, they inſtituted prieſtes, holy daies, rites and Ceremonies. Theſe things are fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in the bokes of the gentiles, &amp; in our hiſtories, and alſo in their writinges, which haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed the heythen Idolaters. But in the popiſh king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at this day, the names beyng only chaunged, who can denie, that the ſame culte, the ſame religion, naye very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not renewed? of theſe thinges I haue treated at large in my booke <hi>De origine erroris.</hi> The Papiſtes teache, that the Sainctes in heauen reigne with God, and that to them are ſubiecte ſickeneſſes, artes, limmes or membres, cities and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinges, and muſte therfore be called vpon and worſhipped. Sainctes are expreſſed and repreſented by Images, to theſe Images are erected Aultars and churches: briefly, it is done to them, that was done to the Goddes and Idolles of the Heythen. Who therefore vnderſtandeth not nowe, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt hath procured, that the firſt beaſte might be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that is to witte, mighte be of force agayne, and that the olde Idolatrie and ſuperſtitiouſe worſhippyng might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and frequented?<note place="margin">Who wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt beaſte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde.</note>

Of the which ſorte out of doubte were the miracles of the Prophetes and Apoſtles, holy Martirs, and chiefly of Moſes and Chriſte. Theſe do good vnto men, hurte not, nor emptye pore mens purſes: yea more they glorifie God, and make the treweth to be beleued, in drawyng men only vnto God as to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of all goodnes.

Furthermore Rome, or the oulde beaſte, had a mooſte honorable Senate. So hath the Byſhppe of Rome alſo, a Princelyke Senate of prowde purpled Cardynalles. For they bee in maner all Princes.

That where the pope is, there is the generall counſell.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:154393:232"/> Where the Pope is, there is our common countrie. He is compelled or reproued of no man, althoughe he be called an heretike. He hath all lawes in his breaſt, or in the ſcroll of his breaſte: he may interprete or expound all thinges. The ſame doth ratifie no ſentence: and it is in him alone, to take away one mans right, and geue it to an other. He maie take awaye priuileges, and at his wyll and pleaſure not onely to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge biſhops, but alſo to depoſe the emperour himſelfe, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare no ſentence of themperour. All the world is the Popes dioceſſe: and the pope is the ordinarie of al, hauing fulnes of power aſwell in ſpiritual matters as te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall. For he is Lord of Lordes, and hath the righte of the King of Kinges ouer all ſubiects. For he hath no pere: and is all thinges, and aboue all, and it is neceſſarie to ſaluation, to be vnder the byſhop of Rome. For ther is one conſiſtorie or iudgement ſeat of God and of the Pope. Theſe thynges haue I taken oute of their owne books, to witte of their Decretalles and gloſes. There is a boke of <hi>Antony Ruſſell</hi> of <hi>Aretine,</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of the Pope and the emperour, where in you may read innumerable things of the ſame ſort. But of theſe thinges which I haue noted hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, I ſuppoſe it be made playne enough, how the Pope which is here alſo called the falſe prophete, hath ſette vp the Image of the beaſte.</p>

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:154393:233"/> parte the ſpirituall haue the chiefe rule. They be for the moſt parte, Chancelours, Secretaries, Ambaſſadours, and what not? And their Pope &amp; King ſayeth openlie, howe he ought to iudge al men, but to be iudged of no man. Yea, and his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures alſo vſurpe the ſame vnto themſelues. Yf ther be any aſſemblee, there the Byſhop of Rome commonly ruleth by his ſpirite, and gouerneth the chiefeſte matters, eſpeciallye matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For vnleſſe the decrees pleaſe the fathers, they threaten that theye wyll abrogate, ſuche thinges as the States haue decreed. But yf there be called a counſell gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or nationall, it is wholly ruled by the popes ſpirite. This ſpeaketh and determineth as it pleaſeth the Pope. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it decree after the Popes pleaſure, he wil go aboute to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolyſh all to gether. For we hearde of late, that the Synode or counſell is there, where the Pope is.

And the gloſe vpon the ſame place noteth, the counſell cannot iudge the Pope, &amp;c. Wherefore yf the whole worlde ſhulde geue ſentence in any matter againſt the Pope, it appeareth that we ought to ſtand to the Popes ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt them al. Yea the ſame gloſier in an other place: The Pope yf he wyll, ſayeth he, maye diſpence againſte the Counſell. For he is more than the Counſell. Moſte trewely therefore ſayde the Lorde at this preſent, howe the beaſt had power, to geue a ſpirite to the beaſte, and that the Image of the beaſte ſhuld ſpeake.

Which I expounded in the .58. ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, &amp; the ſame doth <hi>Albert Krantz</hi> declare excedingly well in the .8. boke .36. <hi>ch.</hi> of Saxon matters. In the place of King <hi>Albert,</hi> was ſubſtituted <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of Lucemburge. But what authoritie ouer him &amp; thempire chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged <hi>Clement</hi> the .5 pope, he that liſt, may know of the <hi>Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tines.</hi> For there is a long treatiſe therof in the .2. boke .9. <hi>tit.</hi> I could alſo rehearce many other lyke things of pope Ihon the .22. and of others, if I ded not thinke it ſuperfluouſe.</p>

For ſo in times paſt wrote <hi>Gregory</hi> the .7. to <hi>Geuſas</hi> king of Hongary: which place read in the .17. chap. of this boke, the ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .75. yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d we in the meane time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the greteſt part of Princes &amp; Nobles haue not knowen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame beaſt, but haue rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned him, &amp; therfore not to come in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nombre of the beaſt,

The ſame is faith, the ſigne of all Gods children. And the fayth in the Father and the Sonne, whiche are not without the holy ghoſt. And howe ſhouldeſt thou beleue, that almightie God is thy father, vnleſſe thou vnderſtande the ſame to be obteined of the ſonne?

Therfore the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the church of Chriſt, the trewe ſhepe, doe beleue that they haue a mercifull father through the ſonne, by whome they knowe that the father beyng pacified, hath geuen all thinges of life and of ſaluation in his ſonne.

The feare of God, hath nothing comon with the feare of the world. The godly man is not affrayed of God, as a gilty ſeruaunt feareth his maiſter, and that more punniſſhment, than his maiſter, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hateth rather. For the feare of God hath the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and loue of God. It attributeth to God the ſupreme Maieſtie, imbraceth faith, and hath a faithful care, wherby it awayteth vpon God, worſhippeth, prayſeth, and profeſſeth the ſame. Doubtles becauſe we more feare men, than God, we feare more the Pope, and the mallice and hatred of him and his, therefore do we not execute iuſtice vprightly, nor profeſſe the trewth frankely, nother yet ſet forth the goſpel. But the lord in the Goſpel ſayeth: feare ye not them, which maye kill the body &amp; haue no power ouer the ſoule: rather feare ye him, which condemneth both body &amp; ſoule to hell fire. Certes the feare of God is not only the beginnyng, but alſo the bonde of al vertue. Hereafter we ſhall heare that the feareful ſhal be
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:154393:254"/> caſte into hel, with the beaſte &amp; with the falſe prophet. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let God be our feare, like as <hi>Eſaye</hi> teacheth in the .8. cha. Let vs feare God for our ſinnes committed. Here fewe are affraide: but many are affraide to ſpeake the trueth, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne godlines, and to rebuke wickednes.</p>
               <p>Secondely the preachyng of the Goſpell comprehendeth the honour of God. For he ſayeth: and geue him honour.<note place="margin">the honour of God.</note> And thou doeſt not ſeperate the ſonne from the father. For he in the .5. of <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayeth thus: the father hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſonne, that al ſhuld honour the ſonne, as thei ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the father.

And hereof the Sainctes gather, that perſecutions ſhall with all be finiſſhed, with all other abominations through out the worlde.

Babilon ſore afflicted the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople of God, So doeth Rome greuouſelye vexe the church of God. Babylon burthened Iſraell wyth a greueouſe captiuitie: So Rome vexeth the church, wyth more than a

And eſpeciallie it is called great. For howe greate and mightie the church of Rome is, all we ſee and by experience knowe at this daye. Nother am I the firſte that vnderſtand by Babilon, Rome.

               <p>The cauſe is ſhewed alſo of the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the common<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>welth and church of Rome:<note place="margin">Why the Romyſhe Church ſhoulde fal</note> for that ſhe hath cauſed all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to drinke, and hath made them dronken wyth wyne of wrath of her fornication. And verelye the effecte of wyne in men is greateſte. Therefore doctrine is compared to it in the Prophetes. Therefore Rome with her vncleane and corrupt opinions, hath made all people dronken. And it is called the wyne of the wrath. For loke with whome God is angry, he ſuffereth them to erre in the way of the Romiſh church. For in aſmoch as God hath reuealed the ſincere doctrine of lyfe, by his onely ſonne, and moſte choſen Apoſtles: and men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue not the ſame: God is iuſtely offended with them, and geueth them ouer into a reprobate mynde, that thei may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe ſhamefull errours: As Saincte Paule alſo prophiſied ſhuld come to paſſe in the .2. to the <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2. chapt.

This maner of ſpeakyng is right well knowen, euen oute of the Prophetes. Rome ded not perſiſte in the doctryne of the Goſpell, and of the Apoſtles, but inuented a newe, and that contarry to the Goſpel, of the vycar of Chriſt in earth,<note place="margin">The deuil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yſh doctrin of Rome.</note> of the power of keyes, of indulgences and pardons, of iuſtification of works and merits, of ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſions, of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images, &amp; prayeng to ſaincts, of celebrating maſſes, and worſhipping of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aulter, as thei terme it,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:154393:257"/> of monkery and vowes, and ſuch other innumerable.

Therefore God powreth oute to her alſo of the cuppe of his wrath, and bryngeth her alſo to deſtruction for euer.</p>

Wherefore let al eccleſiaſticall preachers learne, that they muſt earneſtly, and tirribblie crye oute in this caſe, that all flee the communion of the Romiſh or popiſh church.

               <p>And now let vs heare, what the writte is,<note place="margin">Bleſſed at the dead whiche die in the lord.</note> &amp; what S.

The Lord therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, them to be bleſſed, whiche die in the Lord, then we muſt ſee what he vnderſtandeth by bleſſednes, and who thei be that die in the lord, bleſſednes is that high felicitie, which chaunceth to the faithfull in an other world, in the which we ſhall ſee God him ſelfe as he is, and haue the fruition of him vnto a ioyefull, and neuer lothſomefulnes. We ſhall liue in the ſame with all the Sainctes for euer, and ſhall haue ioynes that can not be expreſſed with tunges of men. Of the whiche ſhall followe more afterwarde. They ſhal reſte from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. And more plentifully in the .21. chapt. And they dye in the Lorde, whiche by faith greffed in Chriſte, layne to him alone, depende wholy vpon him, only regarde him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothynge els but hym alone. For they are ſayed to liue in Chriſte, in whome Chriſt liueth by faith, they that liue in Chriſt do frame their whole life after the will of Chriſt. And
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:154393:260"/> they die in the lord chiefly and before all, whiche for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the lordes faith, ſuffer death, and offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to tourmentes. And not they alone, but thoſe alſo, whiche al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they die of the ſworde of the perſecutours, yet die, when the Lorde calleth them in the trewe chriſten fayth. For theſe are alſo bleſſed, as the Lord in S. Iohn, verely verely I ſaye vnto you, yf any man kepe my worde, he ſhall not ſee death for euer. Howebeit they die not in the lorde, which ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deny god, that they might not be ſlaine: or truſt to their owne merites, &amp; interceſſions of Sainctes, or to other mens workes be they monkes, freres, or maſſemonging prieſtes, and ſo departe out of this life, thinking that thei ſhal be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s workes.

               <p>Finally the Lord him ſelf adioyneth a notable declaration of this his briefe ſentence.

In the .3. chapter. of <hi>S.

And playne it is, that they were deliuered incontinently and moſt fully. In the .5. of <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſame ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he hath paſſed from death to life. Let this place be waied dilligently, and it ſhal appere the ſame alone to ſatiſfie in this matter. In the .6. of <hi>Iohn</hi> he ſayeth openly, and I will reyſe him in the laſte daye. But he reyſeth not the bodies only at the laſte iudgemente, but in euery mans laſte daye, that is in the death of euery one, he preſerueth the ſoules, that they ſhould not periſh, or be tormented, &amp;c. We haue in the goſpel examples moſte clere: to witte of <hi>Lazarus</hi> the beggar, which was by and by after his death caried vp of thaungelles into the boſome of Abraham: and of the thiefe, whiche hearde of the lord, this daye ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe: and of <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaiyng, Lord Ieſus receyue my ſpirite: but eſpecially of our Sauiour, ſaiyng on the croſſe, father into thy handes I commende my ſpirite, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By theſe are quite ouerthrowen, what thinges ſo euer the monkiſſhe and Antichriſtiane doctrine hath buylded of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, of tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>talles, and of the miſerable ſtate of ſoules in an other world.

And this criyng angel cometh out of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. For we hearde before, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſawe a temple in heauen. And where the crier of the iudgement cometh out of the temple, it ſignifieth, that no vnrightuouſnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge is here to be imagined. For the temple is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; rightuouſenes, and is called the houſe of God.

For bi this he ſhadoweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, which the other parable did commend. That plentie maketh for the playner euidence, and beateth in moſt dilligently the certen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and veritie of the iudgement, leeſt herin we ſhulde doubte anything, and wauer with the vnfaithful world. The parable is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vintage. The ſame is vſed very oft of the prophets, ſpeaking of the deſtruction of any nation. And the Lord alſo in the goſpel compareth his people to a vyne. And the Angel holdeth in his hand a ſharpe ſickle. He repreſenteth a fygure of Chriſt, which hath al power of iudgement alone. A ſharpe ſickle, is the ſtraight iudgement, as was ſpoken of the ſickle before. This Angell cometh oute of the temple alſo, to witte a iudge moſte rightuouſe. Vnto him crieth an other Angell, which had power ouer fyer, which cometh out from the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Therfore this Aungell is ſayed to haue power ouer fier. Fier many times in the Pſalmes fignifieth
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:154393:264"/> Gods vengeaunce. This Aungell therfore is here, as it were Maiſter of execution, and captayne of vengeaunce. For An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in <hi>Daniell</hi> alſo, as Gods miniſters, ar ſaied to haue rule ouer thinges: not that we ſhulde worſhip and honour theſe miniſters, but the Lorde that worketh by them. The ſun and moone are the lightes of the world: but therfore no wiſeman wil worſhip them. Here is ſignified playnely, that ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance is certainely prepared for them which ſhed innocent blud on the earth, and that this vengeance ſhal chiefly be executed in the end of this worlde. Albeit that he punnyſh neuertheleſſe greuouſely before the end alſo here in earth, namely parrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: in ſo moch that the Pſalmograph ſayeth, men of bloud ſhall not lyue halfe their tyme. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And as in the parable of harueſte, harueſte was finiſhed with a ſhorte ſentence: So is here alſo vintage ended at few wordes. For ſo ſoone as the vngodly ſhall ſee Chriſte in the clowdes, with the printes of his woundes, and his Sainctes with him, whom thei haue contemned, hated, perſecuted and ſlayne: they wyll gather ſtreight wayes, that they by their iuſt deſert muſt be alotted with Deuylles, whome they haue folowed and ſerued. Therfore ſhal there nede no long diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the matter. Euery mans conſcience ſhall accuſe him, and the ſinnes of euery man ſhalbe manifeſt to al creatures: The vngodly ſhall ſtand before the iudge with great confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in vtter contempte, in payne and feare, and ſorrowes not to be expreſſed, and ſhall go ſtreight wayes into paynes and tourmentes that ſhall neuer haue end.<note place="margin">See the .3. &amp; .5. chapt. of the boke of wiſdom</note> Hereof I ſay, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ofte tymes to make mention, hereof it becometh many tymes to warne all men, that they may beware in tyme, and take hede to themſelues.</p>

And by expoſition he calleth it, the great wynefat of Gods wrath. For the ſame is hel, or the place of pu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niſhment and condemnation. Into this wynefat, ſhall be gathered the cluſters of the Earth, or grapes of the earth, I mean the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thly, and vngodly men. And the citie of God, is heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelf,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:154393:264"/> the ſeate of the bleſſed, which ſhall afterwarde be deſcrybed moſte aboundauntly in the .21. chapter. But that wine preſſe is ſet without the Citie. For in an other place of the Goſpell the Lorde ſayeth alſo, that the wicked muſte be caſte oute, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vttermoſt darkeneſſe, where is weping and gnaſhing of teth.</p>
               <p>But this wynefat is rightlie called the wynefat of Gods yre. For the wrath of God is executed therin: and they with whome God is angrie for their ſinnes, are ſhutte vp therin, that there they may according to their demerits, be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and vexed for euer, and withoute ende. And he calleth it great, for that the place is wyde enough to receiue all the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie. As alſo <hi>Eſaye</hi> hath admoniſhed in the end of the .xxx. chapter. Others reade of the great wrath of God.</p>
               <p>There is added, that out of the fatte or wyne preſſe there runneth no wyne, but blud, and that in moſt plentie. Which he ſhadoweth by a maruelouſe and horrible Hypperbole. The bloud flowed far and broad, by the ſpace of a thouſand and ſixe hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth furlongs. Againe it was very depe. For it came vp to the brydles of the horſes, of them I meane, which went and wraſtled in the bloud, to wit in their owne bloud. By the which Hyperbolical ſpeach is ſignified, that the multitude of the vngodlie ſhalbe greateſt, and that God wil moſt aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntly reuenge that vnmeaſurable blud, which the wicked haue ſpilte in earth. They were delighted whileſt they lyued in earth, with warres, ſlaughter, perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; martirdomes: Therfore will God moſte iuſt, powre vnto them in an other worlde blud enough,<note place="margin">Thou haſt thurſted for bloud, dri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke blud</note> in ſo moch that being drowned in their owne blud vp to the chin, thei may ſeme to bath them in their owne bloud.

Of this phraſe of ſpeache is ſpoken in the firſt chapter. And the true righteouſnes geueth to euery one his. Therefore the Angell ſayeth: Therfore Lord thou arte righteouſe, and declareſte thy righteouſnes to the world, in that thou haſt geuen them bloude to drinke, which haue ſhed the bloude of the Prophetes: that is, of preachers, for preaching of the truth. And not their bloud only, but haue ſhed alſo the bloude of thy holy faythful I meane, whom for the true profeſſing of the faithe they haue vexed, and at laſte ſlayne.

It is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that in au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient time ther were ſeates of Patriarches, <hi>Hieruſalem, Antioche, Rome, Alexandria, Conſtantinople</hi> and others: and that the ſame are called Apoſtolicall ſeates, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Apoſtles haue taught there. And ſo is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall ſeate vſed for the Apoſtolicall doctrine it ſelfe. That
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:154393:275"/> ſeate erected and eſtabliſhed at Rome by the Apoſtles and Apoſtolicke men, the beaſt that is the Pope hath ſubuerted, and in the place therof erected the ſeate of peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which he dare neuertheleſſe cal the ſeate of Chriſte,<note place="margin">Thapoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall ſeate of Chriſt &amp; S. Peter.</note> and the ſeate of S. Peter. Chriſte hath no more any ſeate in Earth, ſaue that he dwelleth in the hartes of the faithfull church. Otherwyſe the trewe ſeate of Chriſt, is the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the father. The trewe ſeate of Peter, is heauen it ſelfe. Rome is no longer his ſeate: for the Apoſtolicall doctrine and Patriarchall chayre is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and troden vnder fote: &amp; in ſteade therof is an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Empire or kingedome ſet vp by the Pope. Yea more he pourſeweth the Apoſtolical ſeates by force of armes. Nowe therefore God hauyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion vpon his, poureth out his wrath and plague on the ſee of Rome, illuminyng men with the light of the Goſpel, to the ende they might know and ſee the wickednes and abomination of the Romiſſhe See. The which is a wonderfull benefite to them that be lighted, and a greate griefe and tormente to the Romiſh ſorte. For theffecte of the plage followeth: and his kyngdome was made darke. This plague aunſwereth to the .9. of Aegipte. For like as thicke darkenes plaged the Aegyptians, bright light reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Iſraelites, ſo were the Papiſtes tourme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meful errours than ſhall it grieue them alſo to haue their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours detected, and their glory obſcured: the faithful ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the light of Chriſt. For now beginneth, and already hath begonne the maieſtie of the ſeate, and of him that ſitteth therein, to be obſcured. That which was ones called an holy ſeate: is now of the godly &amp; learned called, wicked Rome, the whore of Babylon, the mother of al fornications, the denne of theues, <hi>Sodome, Aegipte,</hi> the red harlot by reaſon of the pourple ſenate of Cardinalles, which weare red and purple. It is comonly ſayed and truely, the nerer Rome, the further from Chriſte. They call and that moſte rightly, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles, biſhoppes, and ſpiritual fathers, the familie &amp; limmes of Antichriſt, men diſceaued and diſceauers, with Symony and filthie luſt moſte corrupte. Therfore the kingdome of the beaſt (ſo he expoundeth the ſeate) was made darke. There is added furthermore, howe the worſhippers of the ſeate of the beaſte haue and do behaue themſelues. Firſte for payne and
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:154393:275"/> ſorrowe, indignation, wrath and enuie, they gnawe or bite their tunges: which is the geſture of angry me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potently angry, I meane that burne infuriouſe rage.<note place="margin">The furie of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte the goſpellers.</note> It is a phraſe of ſpeach, ſignifiyng howe they will rage with greate furie agaynſt the trewth opened, which they would haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly hidde and oppreſſed. Agayne they blaſpheme the Lorde of heauen, &amp; maker of al, both for that he afflicteth them with botches, and ſondry plagues, &amp; alſo for that he caſteth a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vpon their kingdome. For euen therfore the Romiſh, cal the preachers of the goſpel diſceauers &amp; heretikes: and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doctrine of the goſpel, hereſie. But this reproche redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to him which is authour of the ſame doctrine. Finally thei do not repent them of their doynges, of theyr Simony, of their craftie iuggelyng, ſacrileges, idolatrie, and al vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. And the apoſtle ſayeth, howe euill men, and diſceauers will waxe worſe and worſe, diſceauing and beyng diſceaued. Therfore is it no maruel, though you ſee the papiſtes at this daye, with a ſtiffenecke to procede obſtinately in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. But the greateſt plague is to be forſaken of God, and ſtubbernely to mayneteyne their errours &amp; vngodlines, and therin to perſeuer. The Lord deliuer vs from euill. Amen.</p>

This plague chiefly apperteyneth to Rome and the Romiſh church. The ſpeach hath an allegorie, or a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret compariſon, and alluſion vnto olde Babilon. We reade in the .5. chapt. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that Babilon was taken the ſame night, wherein <hi>Balthazar</hi> king thereof had prepared a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſe banket, and loked for nothing leſſe than for deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> reporte, howe the kinges of the Eaſte <hi>Darius Priſcus,</hi> who is alſo called <hi>Medus,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> beſieged the citie rounde aboute: but where there was no hope to winne it, <hi>Cyrus</hi> let out Euphrates by ditches, ſo that the Army might wade ouer the riuer: and ſo was the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie layde open, and taken, on the ſame ſide, where it was fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the riuer.

Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and pleaſures, I ſaye, are dimiſhed of the kinges of the Eaſte, of trewe chriſtians, whom the ſcripture calleth the Kinges and Prieſtes, and deriued and putte to an other vſe. Wherefore the power of the Romane churche beginneth to decaye, to the intent that at the length it maye be taken and aboliſſhed of the Lorde Chriſt him ſelfe.

So I ſaye is the waye prepared for the kinges of the Eaſte, ſo beginneth Rome the ſeconde Babilon to be taken and come to naught.</p>
               <p>It followeth furthermore,<note place="margin">Howe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haueth him for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruyng of euphrates.</note> how Antichriſt wil fight againſt the faythfull and godly labouring to drie vp Euphrates, for the mayneteynaunce and increaſe of his kingdome: &amp; where he might briefly haue ſaide, he ſhal ſende forth ambaſſadours vnto al kinges and princes, to ſtire them vp agaynſt the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers, for the defence of the priuileges, rightes &amp; reuenewes of the See of Rome: he had rather moſte dilligently deſcribe thoſe Ambaſſadours, and ſhewe their deſtruction. It forceth very muche to haue knowen the Popes legates. For they are maruelouſe peſtilent to the churche of God: for we haue not only experience of it at this daye, but alſo by the reading of all ſtories, that great euilles,<note place="margin">The deſcri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ption of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popes am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours called le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere.</note> and all calamities in a maner haue ben brought into the church, and are alſo at this daye, through the inſtigations of thoſe legates. I touched a little before, what miſchiefe <hi>Cardinal Iulian Ceſarine</hi> the legate of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> wrought in Germany, Boheme, Pole and Hungary. What is done in our time, and hath ben done in our fathers memorie, it were to longe to reherſe. Yf our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had by the doctrine of Ieſu Chriſt reuealed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church by S. Iohn vnderſtande &amp; knowen the nature of the Popes legates, they might eaſely haue eſchewed, wherewith they haue vndiſcretely intangled themſelues, and ſuffered greate loſſe &amp; hinderaunce. I ſpeake nothing here of Ambaſſadours and ambaſſades of kinges and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welthes vncorrupted.</p>
               <p>Firſt he ſheweth dilligently the original of legates, to the

He ſheweth a threfolde originall, where in very dede they maye al be reduced to one deueliſh vnitie. He ſaw (ſayeth <hi>Primaſius</hi> expounding this place) one ſpirite, and for the nombre of the partes of one body, he ſayeth three, that al the nombre of the wicked might be vttered to be led with one deueliſhe ſprete. Therfore the firſt denne that the legates breake out of he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the dragons mouth. Of the dragon is ſpoken in the .12. chap. nother is there any that vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not, that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil him ſelf.

And the deuil was from the begynning a liar and murtherer, as the lorde him ſelfe ſayeth in the .8. of <hi>Iohn.</hi> And hitherto they be of the Dragons mouthe. The ſelfe ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe alſo out of the mouth of the beaſte. For they come furniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the Popes authoritie, legates laterall with full power. Of the beaſte I haue ſpoken in the .13. chapt. finally they come out of the mouth of the falſe prophete. The trewe prophet and paſtour, high and only of the church vniuerſal, is Chriſt the ſonne of God. Antichriſt, is that falſe prophet, &amp; chiefe ſeducer of the whole world: as is ſayed in the .13. cha. Therfore come the legates, ſente from the Pope, which hath put into their mouthes wordes, or inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſions that they ſhould ſpeake thoſe thinges which are of falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.<note place="margin">Three vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> Howbeit he expoundyng himſelfe more playnely, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth of what ſorte the legates ſhall be: to witte three vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpretes. An vncleane ſprete is euery where in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called the deuill or Sathan, verely of naturr and effecte. For as the ſpirite of God is called holy, ſo this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywiſe vncleane. For he him ſelf is of nature, or rather of his owne corruption, and reuoltyng from God impure, and authour to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all impuretie and vncleanes. He ſignifieth therfore, that thoſe legates ſhal be men of a deueliſh vncleanes. And in dede if you laye hereunto the life, maners, and conuerſation of thoſe legates laterall, and of theyr families, you ſhal finde in maner nothyng els, but extreme vncleanes, filthines and
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:154393:277"/> beaſtelynes, monſtrouſe luſte, whoredome and aduoutrie, and deteſtable fornications, wonderful ſurfettyng, blouddy craftes and counſelles. Therefore the thing it ſelfe ſpeaketh: and the thinges that the legates do euery where, are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary of this place. And where there be three vncleane ſpretes rekened, ſome doe expounde it of diuines, laweyers and religiouſe as monkes and freres, of the which thre ſortes for the moſt parte ar choſen the Popes ambaſſadours. I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande ſimplely by the thirde nombre, that thoſe legates ſhal be moſt furniſhed with all hoſtile authoritie, &amp; that they ſhall all agree wel emonges themſelues, and all helpe one an other: that what ſo euer one ſemeth to lacke, an other maye ſupplie. <hi>Salomon in Eccleſiaſtica,</hi> a threfolde rope or line, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he, wil not lightly breake.</p>
               <p>But now that no man ſhuld finde any lacke of light,<note place="margin">They be like frog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> by a parable brought in, he ſetteth as it were before our eies what maner ones theſe legates ſhal be, verely frogges of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe or fenne, and criers importune and tediouſe, foule and filthie. And he ſayeth not that they be frogges in dede, but like frogges. For like as frogges by their importune criyng are moſte tediouſe and troubleſome, and the fennie are alſo filthie: ſo doe thoſe legates loue earthly thinges and filthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: and by their complainetes, accuſations, prouocations, wrytinges and diſputations altogether froggelyke and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke, be hatefull bothe to God and men.

               <p>Thirdely, he expoundeth the maner of the viſion<note place="margin">The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the viſion.</note> thus: I was caried awaye in ſprete. Wherfore with his body remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in <hi>Patmos,</hi> in ſpirite he ſawe a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſittyng on a beaſt, and diſtroyed with fire. Such be many viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and ſightes in the prophetes. And he noteth alſo the place, wherein he ſawe the beaſte, not in heauen, nother in the temple or tabernacle, or in a fruictful place,<note place="margin">The beaſt in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</note> but in the wilderneſſe. <hi>Eſaye</hi> calleth the gentiles and heythenes, wilderneſſe. And verely tholde Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes and newe with their ſuperſtitions haue had no place in the church, but are without the church: God forbidde tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we ſhould acknowledge the churche of Rome to be head of al faithful churches. And at this daye many of them which are called moſt holy and moſt reuerent, differ nothing from the gentiles, their titles and hipocriſie only excepted. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſpoken before in the .11. chapt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſte he exhibiteth this viſion or tipe of olde and newe Rome, and the ruine and deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them both, and with all deſcribeth moſt dilligently the wickednes of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. And firſt muſt the beaſte be conſidered, after the woman ſittyng on the beaſte. The beaſte repreſenteth the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of olde Rome: the woman of the newe and of Poperie. And the woman ſitteth vpon the beaſt. For the image of the beaſt hath ſucceded, and hath placed her ſeate in olde Rome. For <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo affirmeth, that Antichriſt ſhal pitche his ſeate or palace betwixte two Seas,<note place="margin">The beaſt is roſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured.</note> to witte the <hi>Hadriatical</hi> Sea called commonly the goulfe of <hi>Veniſe,</hi> and the Tyrrhene or Tuſcane Sea. And the beaſte is roſe coloured, it is of a red and bright colour like Crimoſine. For Rome hath ben moſte cruell and blouddy, and ſwimmyng altogether in the bloud of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but eſpecially of Chriſtians.

               <p>Howe the beaſte was full of the names of blaſphemie, I ſhewed in the .13. chapt. Rome abounded with chapelles and Idolles. Dayly it blaſphemed God, Chriſte, the goſpell, and

<pb n="515" facs="tcp:154393:287"/> the ſecrete and true meanynge of the viſion by partes moſte dilligently. And he ſpeaketh in dede of the whole bodie of the beaſte, notwithſtanding that the beaſte hath certen thinges peculier, and likewiſe the whore: yet the Angel himſelfe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: I will ſhewe thee the miſterie of the woman, and of the beaſt that beareth her. Neuertheleſſe this ſame is alſo a darke ſpeaking, where in the beginning of the expoſition he ſaieth: the beaſt which thou ſaweſte, was, and is not. The Romane Empire was yet whyleſt <hi>Domitian</hi> ruled: but it was no more ſuch, as it had ben before. For from the firſt Monarch <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> it was as it were by inheritau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the houſe of <hi>Caeſars,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Nero.</hi> For in him the beaſte receaued a deadlie wounde: but it was healed, and dyuerſe Emperours reigned not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one familie. The Empire therefore had ben in the power of one houſe before, but after <hi>Nero</hi> it was not ſo. Agayne the Romanes poſſeſſed the Empyre after <hi>Nero.</hi> From <hi>Nerua,</hi> which is the .7. after <hi>Nero,</hi> the Empire was deuolted to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iane,</hi> vnder whome it was puiſſaunt and ſtrong. Therfore it was and it was not. Whereof S. Ihon himſelfe will ſpeake a litle after. Moreouer the Stories teſtifie, that the Empyre of Rome was extinguiſſhed, and in his place ſprang vp an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is alſo called the Romane Empire: whereof you may ſay moſte truelie it was, and is not. For that oulde Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, was the moſt ample and nobleſt Empire in the world: but this newe, nowe erected of the Pope, is none ſuch, but rather an Image of the beaſte (as I ſayed in the .13. chapt.) a ſhadowe and a dreame. Therfore we doubt nothing but that in this viſion is exhibited to vs a type, both of the oulde and newe Empire, but chieflye of Poperie.</p>
               <p>And nowe he ſheweth none other originall of the beaſte,<note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the beaſte.</note> but hellyſhe and deuelyſh.

But in caſe the gouernours be corrupted, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng or original is referred to the Deuil, not of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre in dede, but of the corruption. Here is added moreouer, what ende that vnhappy Empyre is lyke to haue at the laſt: and goeth into perdition. For it is cutte vp by the rootes in earth, and addicte in an other worlde to payne euerlaſting.</p>

Iohn Baptiſt, poinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng with his fingar to Chriſt, ſayeth: beholde the lambe of God, which taketh awaye the ſinnes of the world. Therfore ſhal the Romiſh princes fight, not agaynſte Chriſt himſelfe, for they will be chriſtians, but agaynſt the Lambe, that is, the ſanctification, iuſtification and ſatiſfaction of Chriſt. For yf any man ſaye at this daye, that the ſonne of God is moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by whome alone ſinnes are forgeuen, and we are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and ſaye not alſo, that the Biſſhop of Rome is moſte holy alſo, whiche purgeth by pardons graunted, but ſhall ſaye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that perdons are playne diſceiptfulnes, and the Pope moſt vncleane of all: he ſhal doubtles nother be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for right catholicke, nother ſhal he be ſpared for confeſſyng the lambe
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:154393:291"/> of God. Yf any man ſhal confeſſe that iuſtification is only in the ſonne of God alone, and that men are iuſtified by fayth only, and not alſo by our workes and merites, he ſhal be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to death or to priſon, nother ſhal the confeſſion of the lambe of God preuayle him any thing. Yf any man ſhal ſay, that he is fully purged through the only oblation of Chriſte on the croſſe, as of a lambe without ſpotte, and ſacrificed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginnyng, neyther that he nedeth any popiſh Maſſes, wherby the ſhauelynges boaſte that they make a dayly offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the ſinnes of the quicke and dead, whiche in dede is both falſe, and blaſphemouſe, he is ſtreight wayes hurried to priſon, and from thence drawen to the ſtake and brente. We can not denye but that this is true, ſeyng there be at this daie innumerable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of Romiſhe kinges and princes in this behalfe. We ſhall not nede therefore to fetche our expoſition farre of, how theſe kinges, which wholy depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of the Pope ſhal fight with the lambe. I ſpeake here nothinge of others, which cleaue whole vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore for a comforte is conſequently annexed, and the Lambe ſhall ouer come them.<note place="margin">The la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be ſhall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> For albeit that Popiſh kinges and Princes ſeme to ouercome the Sainctes, whom they burne, murther, and diſtroye, yet Chriſt liueth for euer, the redemption of Chriſte floriſſheth. As moſte godly that good poete hath ſonge:
<q>
                     <l>Chriſt liueth yet, and ſhal do ſtill,</l>
                     <l>His trewth eke ſhall remayne,</l>

                     <l>Shall periſh and be vayne.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Kinges periſh, kingdomes periſh or be chaunged: but the trewth is neuer chaunged, Chriſt periſheth neuer. He adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a moſt ſtrong reaſon: for he is Lord of Lordes, and king of kinges. Therfore ſhal they be made a fote ſtole for the fete of the Lambe, as many as ſhall ſtriue agaynſt him. You ſee agayne, whie S. Iohn ſayed before: they receiue power as kinges. For all kinges are vnder Chriſt, whiche excelleth all lordes in the worlde. For to him is geuen power in Heauen and in earth. Let vs therfore be of bold courage. For the lord is Emperour, and our king almightie, immortall, and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. He wil come ſhortely in the clowdes of thayre, to iudge

It is referred rather to the nexte, to God I meane, which put into the heartes of the kinges to do his wil, I ſay of God. For it is the mynde and will of God, that the beaſt ſhulde periſh, that punniſhment be taken of her, for ſhedyng of innocent bloude. The ſame God will procure that kinges ſhal not be at diſcord, but at concord, that being of one mynd and accorde, they may execute Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

               <p>Nother is there any matter here, to buſy our ſelues much aboute. The ſome of all is this.

               <p>Howbeit nother Chriſt himſelf,<note place="margin">Kings and marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes mourne.</note> nor the Apoſtle is brought in, bewayling the ſubuerſion of Babilon: but wicked perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Agayne we muſte ſomewhat alſo conſider the mourning. To mourne of it ſelfe, is no ſin. For the beſte and holyeſt men haue lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted their dead, and their calamities, &amp; deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of cities and realmes.

Howebeit in the lamentation they kepte a meane, and referred all thinge to the glory of God, and ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of foules. The vngodly and worldly men do not mourne after this ſort. They neuer reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the ſines of men, for the whiche the righteouſe Lorde punniſheth the world, nother do they referre the euylles of them and theirs to the glory, veritie, and iuſtice of God, or ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: therefore are they not ſory that God is offended, nor requyre forgeuenes of ſinnes: but it greueth them that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinninge is taken from them, that their pleaſures and lucre is paſt. And nowe wayle Princes, marchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, not for the fauoure of God loſte, not of true compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or loue of their neighbour, but for loue of themſelues, for the loſſe of earthly things, for the deſtruction of goodly, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ſtrong and preciouſe things: but chiefly for their lucre loſte, and pleaſures taken away. The Apoſtle maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eyther grefe in the ſeconde to the <hi>Corrinthians</hi> the .7. chapter. And ſurely this ſorrowe and mourning is nothing els, but a deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and a ſhaddowing of a moſte certen and greateſte deſtruction, and that of men vngodly. And ful well and pourpoſely doeth he ſet forth the wayling both in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of the mourners, &amp; alſo by their woordes.

Others are glad agayne of the calamities, and plages of the vngodly, yet bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng no mallice towardes them, whiche are in this miſerie: vnto whom thei wold doubtleſſe haue wiſhed a better ſtate, if they might haue ben perſwaded to haue tourned but they reioyce rather ouer iuſtice reuenged, and the godly deliuered from the tiranny of the wicked. Whereof we reade that the

Therfore are the rightuouſe glad, &amp; reioyce when they ſee vengeaunce. And it is not ſayde, that they couet, or wiſhe for vengeaunce. Vengeaunce is mine, ſayeth the lord, I wil rewarde. When the lorde therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth they are glad for the deliueraunce, and for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> veritie eſtabliſhed and confirmed: and reioyce not of an hatred they heare towarde the oppreſſours, whom they haue wiſhed loſt and deſtroyed. The godly wiſſhe euermore the wicked to be conuerted, and to retourne into fauour with God. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſee them moued with no repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taunce, but obſtinately to procede, and falle into their owne deſtruction, and that God doeth intercepte them, for the ſaluation of the faythfull, and deliueraunce of the godly: the godly reioyce at this deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, and prayſe the iuſtice of God. Notwithſtanding that they had alwayes rather, if it mighte haue ben, that the loſte had otherwiſe led their life: but nowe ſins it can be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, through their owne obſtinate mallice, they ſpeake not againſt the iudgementes of God, but rather commende the ſame. Theſe thinges verely do the ſainctes in Earth. And the Sainctes in heauen ſins they be purified now from all affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their reioycing is altogether moſt pure, ſo that it were ſuperfluouſe to reaſon curiouſely therof. But where the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly reioyce at the deſtruction of the wicked, we maye eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iudge howe muche they erre, whiche truſte to the helpe or prayers of Sainctes: where neuertheleſſe they alter nothing at all of their wicked life.

For at the ſame time when <hi>S. Iohn</hi> wrote theſe thinges, all thapoſtles in a maner were ſlaine.

For in the .6. chapt. the ſoules of Martirs crie vnder the Aultar: howe longe Lord auengeſt thou not our bloud on them that be on Earth? nowe therefore they prayſe Gods iuſtice, whiche as he than promiſed that he would auenge, ſo hath he nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged in dede.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of her deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>In the ſeuenth and laſt place are ſet forth agayne the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this ſubuerſion, and that more notable three. The firſt: Thy marchauntes were princes of the Earth. For they that haue occupied marchandiſe in the church of Rome, and yet
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:154393:308"/> do, are in a maner princes. Of whom I haue ſpoken before. Here is noted therfore their pride, auarice, and ſumptuouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. <hi>Aretas:</hi> he calleth them marchauntes, ſayeth he, whiche tourmoyle and trouble the whole worlde, as it were certen fayres, &amp;c. The ſeconde: for with thine inchauntementes all nations haue ben ſeduced. There is no doubte, but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntyng, and magicke raigne in Babilon, and that there is founde plentie of fortune readers, necromanciers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunters: yet here appereth chiefly to be ſignified, ſeducing, Idolatrie, and impietie, or errour of doctrine. Suche an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunter was <hi>Iezabel,</hi> as appereth in the .4. booke of <hi>Kinges</hi> the .9. chapt. which practiſed inchauntementes in very dede, and bewitched men with corrupt religion. And euen ſo hath Rome ſeduced the whole worlde, and yet ſeduceth. For the which cauſe ſhe deſerueth moſt greuouſe punniſhment. The laſt cauſe of ſubuerſion: for in thee is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the bloud. Bloud ſhed can not be whipte awaye nor clenſed from them, that ſhede innocent bloud.<note place="margin">The ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloud.</note> And although it be not ſtreight waye required: yet will there come a time when it ſhal be required of God, and than is it founde. And he maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of thre ſortes of bloud. Firſte of the bloud of Prophetes, of them I meane, which haue preached the Goſpell, and haue ben the fathers of the faithfull. Secondely of Sainctes to witte holy martirs. Finally of al menne that haue ben ſlayne in earth to witte dwelling here and there through out the world: whom we vnderſtande to haue ben diſpatched and taken out of the waye, by the warres, ſeditions, and tiranny of Rome. So we reade alſo in the firſt oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> that God ſtraitely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth the bloud of his ſeruauntes ſpilte. Doubtles all ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of bloud is greuouſe (the ſame excepted which is iuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done of the magiſtrate) yet is one more heynouſe than an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other. For he that killeth a preacher of the goſpell, more gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſely ſinneth, than he that diſpatcheth a priuate perſon: and he whiche for religion ſake ſlayeth a man, and maketh a martir, ſinneth more heynouſely, than he that killeth a man in the warre. Therefore al the bloud ſhed of Rome after any ſort, ſhal be required of Rome, &amp; is required. Thus the lorde ſpake alſo of the citie of Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.

For God by the Angell commaundeth the ſainctes to prayſe. Now therfore they obey God, and offer to him praiſes. And howe great theſe prayſes were, he ſheweth by a double compariſon, and by a maruelouſe breuitie, and euident maner. For he ſayeth, how the voices of the ſingers were ſhrille, as the guſſhing and noyſe of many waters: alſo like the clappyng or crackyng of greate thonders. Yf ſuche

But no man marueleth, no man ſetteth forth or commendeth the holy Scriptures and elegancie and efficacitie of the ſame, wauntyng example. And agayne is annexed an Hymne, the beginnyng whereof, as of the fourmer, is alſo <hi>Alleluya.</hi> And like as in the fourmer himne the Sainctes haue celebrated, that God doeth iuſtely punniſhe the wicked: ſo in this they preache that God raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and ſhall ſeme euen freely to ſaue the Sainctes. They commaunde therefore to prayſe the Lorde. The reaſon, for bicauſe ſins he is omnipotent, he raigneth. He hath verely raygned euermore: but ſins ſo many thinges haue ben per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him to the vngodly, many haue thought that the vngodly, and chiefely Antichriſt hath reigned: but now ſins he hath oppreſſed him, and auenged his glory and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, it is made manifeſte to all menne, that God alone raigneth for euermore. They alledge alſo an other cauſe, whie God ſhould be prayſed, ye rather whie the godly ſhuld be glad and reioyce: for the mariage of the Lambe is come. For as much as that time is nowe come, wherein the lambe him ſelfe will bryng in the children of God, his wel be loued ſpowſe, thoſe I meane whome by his bloudſhed he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed, to ioyes euerlaſtyng.

The firſt, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath iudged the whore, and auenged the bloud of Sainctes. The ſecond, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the lambe is come. They reioyce therefore at the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, whereby he hath punniſhed the vngodly: and at his mercy or grace, by the whiche he geueth to the godly a bleſſed lyfe. But here muſte we ſpeake of the mariage.</p>
               <p>Ther is very much mention made in the holy Scriptures both of the oulde and newe teſtamente,<note place="margin">Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> of matrimonie and mariage. The which may not be expounded after the letter, but by an allegory: leeſt with the Turks and mahometiſtes, we fall in ſhameful and mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrouſe abſurdities. For ſpiritual things are figured by corporal matters. Of the ſpiritual this is the ſome: God the father the louer of mankinde, wil ſaue men by his ſon. This thing is declared by a parable of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke and mariage. And in matrimonie there is a contract or makynge ſure, there is coupling or handfaſte makyng of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partie, and finally mariage.</p>
               <p>In the contracte not onely the yong man and the mayde ar affiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kyng ſure.</note> but alſo the whole maner of the mariage to com is appoincted, and an order taken. For the lawyers ſay, that affiauncyng is a promeſſe of the mariage to come. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracte was made at the beginning of the world, where God promiſeth that he wyll delyuer mankynde by his ſonne, and receiue him into glory. Hereunto appertaine all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Chriſte, of the remiſſion of ſinnes, and euerlaſtinge lyfe. Moreouer the duties of the ſpouſe are preſcrybed. She promeſeth to be obedient, and other thinges, &amp;c. Chriſte the ſonne of God the father, brydegrome, affiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth to himſelfe al the choſen through his free grace: he promiſeth them his righteouſnes, all heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly gyftes and eternall lyfe. He taketh vpon him moreouer al the infirmities of the bride, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth her filthines. And the bryde is affiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to him by faith, as it is with <hi>Oſee,</hi> and byndeth her ſelfe wholly to him: after whoſe will and lawe ſhe frameth her ſelfe wholly. For ſhe is the body of a liuely head. As <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaieth in the <hi>.5.</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> The bride leaders be the, prophets, patriarkes, Apoſtles. So <hi>Ihon Bapt.</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

But immediatly after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was a league or bonde made betwixte God and men, which is ofte tymes red of, not withoute ceremonies, certen wordes and ſacrifices repared, as by <hi>Abraham, Moſes</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

Hereunto belonge all thoſe thinges, that God woulde be in league with man, and haue men bounden to him, and all his thinges communicated to vs. And this mariage, of all others is moſt ſtraightly ioyned and made, whyleſte the ſonne of God hath vnited our fleſhe into one and the ſame perſon with him, and hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Apoſtles to preach vnto all, that he wyll haue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the faithful.

For ſeyng the Lord himſelf ſayeth of Sainctes, thei ſhal be as the Angelles of God: I ſee not whie they ſhoulde not match the Sainctes with Angels.

For Angelles ſerue God after their maner: and ſo doe menne ſerue God after theyr ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: yet are all ſeruauntes, and that the ſeruauntes of one maiſter. And it is agaynſte reaſon that one ſeruaunt ſhould honour and worſhip and other of his fellowes, beyng of the ſame ſtate and creation. It is therfore an vnworthie matter, that the faithful ſhould worſhip the Apoſtles, Prophetes, or Martirs: muche leſſe doeth it become them to honour their dead bones. And leeſte any man ſhould ſaye, how thangel in dede in reſpecte of the moſte excellent Apoſtle S. Iohn, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelf to be his felowe ſeruaunt: but that there is an other conſideration to be had of other men, which come not nere the dignitie of bleſſed <hi>Iohn:</hi> &amp; therefore ſins we be much inferiour, we maie worſhip Angelles and Apoſtles our ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours:<note place="margin">The bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne of Iohn, and Chriſt.</note> he preuenteth and ſayeth, and of thy bretherne. And who be the bretherne of the Apoſtle S. Iohn? the Angel him ſelfe aunſwereth, and ſayeth, whiche haue the teſtimony of Ieſu. The teſtimony of Ieſus, is the goſpell, &amp; the very fayth fixed on the goſpell, comprehendyng with a faythfull minde Ieſus.

And here is dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentely to be noted, that by faith we are made the bretherne of Chriſt, of Angelles and Apoſtles. This ſhuld the Monkes and Freres haue beaten in and ſet forth, and not the frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of our Lady, and fraternities of Sainctes: vnleſſe they had ben the Apoſtles of that great &amp; abominable Antichriſt.</p>

Of the whiche expoſition ſuch an argument maye be gathered: the cauſe of thy worſhippyng, <hi>Iohn,</hi> is doubtles that excellent reuelation and prophecie, vnto thee by me reuealed. But yf I ſhould therefore ſeme worthie to be worſhipped, for that there is in me an excellent ſprete of Prophecie: by the like reaſon ſhalt thou worſhip al thy bretherne, in whome is the ſame ſprete of prophecie, to witte the teſtimony of Ieſu, the true fayth.

It is accompted at this daye emonges the chiefeſt vertues of Princes, if a Prince will geue no place to the preachyng of the goſpel, but the ſame ſhut out, wil defende and maineteine the church of Rome, with thoſe doctrines, rites, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies falſely called olde.

For he addeth: and he toke the Dragon, &amp;c. And he repeteth the names of our enemie out of the <hi>.12.</hi> chapt. where euery thing is expounded. Where you maye alſo loke for the ſame. And the Aungell did binde Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, whiche is the ende and vſe of the chayne, verely that he ſhould not be ſtirre him, and inuade and diſtroye the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Moreouer there followeth an other thinge yet more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement: and he ſente him into the bottomleſſe pitte: to witte he caſte him headlonge into the botome of hel, that he ſhould not murder the faythful. There followeth an other thing yet more greuouſe: and he ſhutte him vp, that he ſhuld not come out agayne. This is the ende and vſe of the keye.

But letters, priſones, graues are wonte to be ſealed, and that for truſte and credit, leeſt any manne ſhoulde vndoe them, but that they mighte remayne ſhutte, ſealed and ſafe. And all theſe thinges ſignifie a full and moſt perfit victory, which we haue obteined through Chriſt, by the worde of the goſpell preached vnto vs, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through fayth. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs he ouercame, ouerthrewe, bounde, locked vp, and ſealed the enemie, that we might be ſafe and ſure from him. Finally it followeth, which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare al and ſingular partes hereof:<note place="margin">That he ſhoulde no more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the people.</note> to the ende he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the people no more, to witte by ſuch meanes as he dyd ſeduce them before the victory of Chriſte, &amp; before the goſpell preached through out the worlde.

Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of Gods or Idolles were euery where, Idolles were worſhipped, the ſame gaue oracles, Aultars ſmoked with the bloud of men &amp; beaſtes. All wickednes raigned.

No man can eaſely expreſſe, not in a longe oration, how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Sathan had diſceaued the worlde, howe aſſuredly
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:154393:326"/> be raigned, and with what intricatenes he hath bounde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him mankinde like a bondeſlaue. Let him loke, who ſo liſte, vpon Grece.

But after that <hi>Paule</hi> alone (I will ſpeake nothing now of the other Apoſtles) came to <hi>Corinth, Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and there had preached Chriſte: who can not ſee, howe truely S.

I am the briefer in this matter moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, for that I thinke I haue done enough, yf I ſhewe only ſome foteſteppes, wherein goyng ye maye come to a muche more ample conſideration of theſe thinges. Hereunto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne thoſe diuine wordes of S.

For this intente haue I appered vnto thee (ſayeth the lord to <hi>S.

Euery man alſo maye iudge of the thinges that haue ben treated hitherto, whether he haue profited in the doctrine of the goſpel, which he hath a longe time hearde in the temple. For in caſe thou thy ſelf be as yet bounden ſtil with the chayne of the Deuill, thou haſte not yet hearde the goſpell, as apperteyneth: but if thou feleſt that the Deuill is bounde with the chayne, and that thou ruleſt the Deuil, and the Deuill not thee, the matter goeth well.

               <p>Nother am I very ſcrupulouſe in ſearchyng out the terme of the ſupputation of theſe thouſande yeres.<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning of the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pte of a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de yeres.</note> Simplely I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyncte the beginnyng of the rekening in the open preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of the Goſpell, and what time the worde beganne now to be receyued, and was nowe receyued of the Gentiles.

Thou wilt ſaye than, that aboute that time the Deuill brake lowſe agayne, and ſeduced the people, eſpecially by Popes. Or beginne the ſupputation of the thouſande yeres from that time, wherein <hi>Paule</hi> beyng bounde for the Goſpell at Rome, teſtified that the goſpell was preached through out the worlde.

               <p>Some man wil ſay, I cannot ſee that the preaching of the
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:154393:327"/> Goſpell hath continued in the worlde ſo long tyme, to witte a thouſande yeares, For it appeareth by Hiſtories, that the doctrine of merites, ſatiſfactions, and iuſtification of works, ded inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently after the Apoſtles time, lay their firſt ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. We knowe that the interceſſions of Sainctes, and the worſhipping of relicques, were defended of <hi>Saincte Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> which departed out of this world the yeare of our Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des incarnation <hi>.422.</hi> We knowe that the Biſhop of Rome ded immediately after the death of <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſte, take v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him to be head and catholique Paſtor of the church vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall.

                  </hi> ſeduced a great parte of the world. We knowe that ſhortely after, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe that deteſtable contention about the hauing of Images in the churches of Chriſtians. We haue heard that S.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſayeſte, I ſee not howe the Deuyll hath ben boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a thouſande yeares: and locked in chaynes.<note place="margin">Howe the deuyl hath ben bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den a thouſand yeares.</note> I aunſwere that the things which are alledged hitherto, are true: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe to be true, and ſo to remayne alwayes, which S. Ihon by the reuelation of Ieſu Chriſte hath affirmed, that the Deuyll ſhoulde be ſhutte vp for a thouſande yeares, and remayne bounden, tyll a thouſande yeares were at an ende. And the ſame we declare on this wyſe. The Lorde ſayde in the Goſpel. Nowe is the iudgement of the world, nowe ſhall the Prince of this world be caſte out. And where as it is not lawfull to doubt of the veritie of Chriſtes wordes, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe is he not red to be ſo caſte oute, but that he hath ben of greate force in the worlde, and hath bene called of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelues, the Prince of this worlde. Howe than is he ſayde to be caſt oute, and to tempte the godlie, to raigne, and to be caſte oute of his Kyngdome?</p>
               <p>He is caſt out of the church, and of the faithful,<note place="margin">Howe Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>than is caſt oute, &amp; yet vexeth the faythfull.</note> not that he cometh not againe, and tempteth, for alwayes he returneth, and ſeketh to plucke backe the redemed (but for that he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth no more the ful empire. For Chriſt now liueth, &amp; raineth in the church and Sainctes. Theſe, as S. Auſten ſaieth, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayleth
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:154393:328"/> from without) he is caſt oute of his auncient poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he laboureth to recouer his olde habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And thus was Sathan bounde, and ſhutte vp for a thouſand yeares, as he that poſſeſſed not the faythfull of Chriſte through out the worlde, nor ruled them at his pleaſure, and after his mallice, although he hath tempted and vexed them. So was the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt denied to be geuen, not that he was not in the world and in the Prophets: but becauſe he was neuer ſo plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powred oute vpon all fleſhe, as after the glorifienge of our Lorde Chriſte. In the ſame ſenſe we ſay, that death and ſinne are taken away from the faythfull, and troden vnder fote. As <hi>S. Paule</hi> therfore, which in the firſt chapt. to the <hi>Colloſs.</hi> ſaide, that we are tranſlated oute of the kyngdome of darkenes, in to the kyngdome of light: ſayeth neuertheleſſe to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> that the God of this world, hath blynded the myndes of the vnfaythfull: ſo S. Ihon at this preſente ſayeth, howe the Deuyll is bounde and ſealed, by the ſpace of a thouſande yeares, and the very ſame ſayeth afterwarde, the reſte of the dead reuiued not, til the thouſand yeares ſhould be fulfilled: that is to ſay, in al thoſe thouſand yeares beleued not, which ſet more by the beaſt, than they ded by Chriſte. And they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely through their owne faulte, and inſtigation of the Deuill beleued not, and periſhed. Therfore ded Sathan exerciſe his force in them. Which to the faithful in dede is bounden, and tyed faſte, but to the vnfaithfull free and ouer familier. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe Hell is ſhut to the godly, to the wicked open. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo we confeſſe in the crede, lyfe euerlaſting, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath or damnation euerlaſting. For the faithfull haue no Hel, or there is no Hell prepared for them: but for the vngodlye. For Chriſte hath broken Hell, but for his faithfull: to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfull all thinges of hell are yet moſte ſtronge, and theſe haue Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">¶ The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Deuyll by Chriſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note>Agayne the Deuyll is ſayed to be bounden, ſhutte vp, and ſealed: for ſince the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, his power hath not bene ſo great in the worlde, as it was before. Wherefore S. Ihon expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth himſelfe, and ſayeth: that he ſhuld deceaue the people no more. What is this more? but that he ſhal not ſo ſeduce them from hence foorth, as he hath done hitherto. Therefore al be it in the meane whyle he ſhall deceaue ſome,
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:154393:328"/> yet in thoſe thouſand yeares he hath not raigned ſo fully, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly &amp; at large, as he ded before, and as it is permitted him after thoſe thouſand yeares to rage. Therfore theſe things ar ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, and not abſolutely. And the thing it ſelfe, or experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce teacheth, that they are not to be vnderſtand ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and after the bare lettre. Although therfore that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than hath in theſe thouſand yeares alſo, blowen his poyſon vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many, and hath troubled the world, yet this is nothing, in compariſon of thoſe thinges, that haue followed after the thouſand yeares euen vntill this day, and ſhall followe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after vnto the worlds end. In oulde time alſo he raigned ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emongs the Gentiles through Idolatry. But a thouſand yeares fell downe their temples and Idolles, with all other inſtrumentes of vngodlyneſſe.</p>
               <p>We reade truely,<note place="margin">Certen ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> howe there were in the Apoſtles time that affirmed, that men are iuſtified by the lawe and workes. Whereupon ſprange vp the doctryne of ſatiſfaction and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites. But the ſame doctryne was confuted by the Apoſtle <hi>Saincte Paule,</hi> aboue other Apoſtles. <hi>Saincte Auſten</hi> alſo, and after him <hi>Bede,</hi> moſte conſtantlie haue defended the doctrine of grace, and redemption by Chriſt. The ſame continued ſafe by the ſpace of a thouſande whoale yeares. But afterwarde, Freres getting the vpper hande, the doctryne of ſatiſfaction and mannes merites ded preuayle: whereupon was vtterly obſcured the doctrine of Ieſu Chriſte, conſerning the free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes, &amp; imputing of righteouſnes. Ther grewe vp an opinion with certen of Sainctes, makyng interceſſion or prayeng in heauen for their worſhyppers. The relicques be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be worſhipped ouer ſoone. Neuertheleſſe ſuch as wer illumined claue faſt to the onely interceſſour Chriſt, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored not relicques. But after thoſe thouſande fatal yeares, many attributed more to Saincts, than to the very holy one of Sainctes. We ſee what is done at this day. The writings of Monkes and Freres teſtifie, how much the worſhipping of creatures hath increaſed within theſe .iiii. hondreth yeres, or there aboutes. Who wyl deny that exceding many haue ben deceaued of Heretikes? But who can gather thereby that the Goſpell hath bene vtterlie loſte, &amp; that Sathan hath raigned fullye?</p>
               <pb n="598" facs="tcp:154393:329"/>
               <p>The Byſhoppe of Rome hath aſcended in to the toppe of Mounte <hi>Zion,</hi> and will be called the head and Paſtour gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the whole catholique church. Howbeit the Eaſte moſt conſtantlie reſiſted, and ſo ded other partes of the world alſo. At the lengthe after a thouſande yeares, he made his boaſte moſt impudently, that the fulneſſe of power was geuen him, which he got by hoke and croke, and after vſurped the ſame. <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſeduced many, yet neuertheleſſe the Patriarchall churches perſiſted, and the Eaſte honoured Chriſt, lykewiſe South and North, ſo that the thouſande yeares agayne had their lighte, nother hath Sathan in theſe raged ſo much, as he hath ſince thoſe yeares were complete. Doubteleſſe ſince the Turkes bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to rule and raigne, al matters of religion grewe euery daye worſe and worſe. And the warre into the Holy land ded very much hurte to religion, and gaue greate courage to the Saracenes and vngodlye: whereof I ſhall ſpeake afterwardes. And Images beganne to be ſette vp in temples, and to be defended. But the Hiſtories teſtifie that the ſame was done with greate difficultie, and hardlie could the vſe of them be obtayned, all good men moſte conſtantlie reſiſting. And what time they were now admitted, yet were not the Idolaters ſo ſtarke mad, as we ſe they are nowe, and haue ben certen yeares paſte. Wherefore it is rightly ſayed, howe after a thouſand yeares, Sathan ſhulde be looſed from his chaynes, which before alſo moued the vnbeleuers, yet fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally rageth more furiouſly.</p>
               <p>S. Ihon aſſigned to Antichriſt a certen numbre of yeares, to wit <hi>.666.</hi> Whereof we myghte vnderſtande the name of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſte. But therefore it foloweth not, that the Deuyll was than quyte lowſed, or the lyght of the Goſpell vtterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſſhed. For the Apoſtle in his time, ſpeakyng of him: The miſterie, ſayeth he, of iniquitie nowe worketh. Antichriſte therefore hath his ſeedes, he hath his beginnyng, he hath his ryſing vp, his growyng and increaces. But after a thouſand yeares, he went to worke moſte impudently and moſt bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which before alſo had vttered his maliciouſnes: but nowe moſte venemouſly of al he ſpeweth oute his poyſon, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Kynges, and all that ſpeake neuer ſo little againſte him. We knowe moreouer that in theſe thouſande yeares paſte,
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:154393:329"/> the Deuill hath raygned in many by murder, periurie and innumerable and vnſpeakeable euilles. But if ye conſider what hath ben done ſins thoſe thouſande yeres, and what is done at this daye: you will ſaye thoſe ages of the thouſande yeres to haue ben Golden and Siluer worldes: and oures nowe for theſe fiue hondreth yeres to be of braſſe, Iron, leed,<note place="margin">The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt age.</note> and claye. <hi>Lactantius</hi> in the ſeuenth booke of <hi>Inſtit.</hi> the <hi>.15.</hi> chapter towardes the laſte ende of the worlde, ſayeth he, the ſtate of worldly matters muſte nedes be altered, and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie preuayling, to incline to the worſe: ſo that theſe our times, in the which iniquitie and miſchiefe is growen to the higheſt degree, yet in compariſon of that vncurable euil, maye be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted fortunate and in maner Golden ages.

For S. Iohn himſelfe confuteth this opinion, whileſt he ſheweth, how the ſainctes ſhould be beheaded of the beaſte and of his Image: and that the others which remayne in death, ſhould not liue agayne, or receyue the goſpel of Chriſt. It is manifeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the beaſte, &amp; his Image ſhal be in thoſe thouſandes yeres.

For by an expoſition it is taken, as though you ſhould ſaye, they that ſat on the Heauenly ſeates, were the ſoules of them that are beheaded. Soules are not beheaded, but bodies: the ſoules remayne in their ſtate and life. Wherefore he ſayeth the ſoules of them whoſe bodies were beheaded or ſlayne. And here lette vs note, that S.

Not for that they raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not &amp; liued with Chriſte afterwarde, but for that their ſoules hitherto, or to the iudgement, haue not ſlept, but haue liued rather in Heauen a bleſſed life. The whiche alſo from the beginnyng he declareth by an other notation. For he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſeate (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) ſet, and the ſoules ſitting in them. And by a figuratiue ſpeache he ſignifieth, that certen ſeates, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable places, are prepared in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the bleſſed ſoules, as alſo the Lorde him ſelf ſayeth in the goſpel: In my fathers houſe are many manſions, and nowe I goe to prepare you a place. He calleth the ſeates thrones, alludyng to the royall Trones of kinges. But of theſe celeſtial ſeates, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, greater, diuine, and ſpiritual matters.

This I ſaye is the maner of the ſoules and ſpirites to ſitte. He addeth moreouer, howe to thoſe ſoules was geuen iudgement, verely for that they ar exempted from iudgement, and come not into iudgement (euen as our ſauiour ſayeth) but haue paſſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life. It is alſo declared in an other place, in what ſenſe the ſaincts are ſayed to ſitte vpon the ſeates, and iudge the world: where it is manifeſte in dede, that all the iudgement of God is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ſonne. It is euident therfore by this vnfallible place of ſcripture, that the ſoules of ſaincts ſlepe not after the death of the body, vntill the laſte iudgement, but to liue in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with Chriſte. But at the iudgemente they ſhall retourne to their bodies reyſed agayne, and together with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhal be receyued into bleſſed ſeates.

Now is added to this membre: but the remnaunt of the dead, whiche are nother regenerated through fayth, nor would beſtowe their life for Chriſte, but had rather worſhip the beaſt and his Image, theſe I ſaye for their vnbeliefe liued not. For without faith there is no trewe life in this worlde.<note place="margin">A double life &amp; dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death.</note> We ſpeake nothing here of the vital or naturall life.

For the Lorde him ſelfe ſayeth: he that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me, he ſhal liue alſo for me.

And the Lord alſo to the diſciple, that wold retourne home, and burie his pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, ſayeth: ſuffer the dead to burie their dead. There is alſo a death euerlaſtyng, that is euerlaſtyng wretchednes and miſerie, whiche followeth the ſpiritual.

               <p>And S. Iohn himſelf agayne expoundyng himſelf ſayeth. This is that firſte reſurrection.

Therfore be they not pertakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt reſurrection, ſo many as nother acknowledge their ſinnes, nor be regenerated, nother are quickened by fayth in Chriſt, nor riſe againe with Chriſt in the newnes of life.

And Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie had his beginnyng and procedyng ouer ſoone: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a thouſande yeres it was of full force.

For after thoſe thouſande yeres at the length came vp the ſecte or order of Iacobines, Celeſtines, Gilbertines, of Graye freres, blacke freres, white freres, and many other freres, and monſtrouſe Mounkes, whiche haue craftely cropen in the fauour of all princes, to thintent they might know al their ſecretes by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confeſſion.

               <p>Hiſtoriographers report many things of the battel af Troy. Others ſuppoſe that thoſe of Aſſyria and Babilon wer gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atter.

In this haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together in maigne battaylles, with multitudes of men innumerable, in a maner all nations and people of the whole world inhabited.

<pb n="623" facs="tcp:154393:341"/> and from the wrath of the lambe, &amp;c. By whiche wordes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though be deſcribed the effecte of a deſperate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience out of corrupte doctrine: yet the ſame ſhall appere chiefely in this iudgement, what time the ſeuere and moſte rightuous iudge ſhall appere. A muche like figure is red in the <hi>.18. Pſalme.</hi> Where is added, and their place was no more fownde: it is annexed to amplifie the matter, not that Heauen and Earth ſhal be no where, but for ſo muche as they dare not (whiche is ſpoken by a figure) appere in the iudgement of God. By al theſe thinges therfore is ſignified, that the vngodly beyng deſtitute of all counſell, ſhal not knowe at that daye whither to tourne them, or what to doe: but trembling and deſpay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng to be vexed with vnſpeakeable tormentes before the ſeate. It might be thought in the meane ſeaſon, that S. Iohn ſignifieth this alſo, howe heauen and earth ſhould at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of the iudge be renewed. The whiche alſo the Apoſtle S. Peter more playnely expreſſeth in the <hi>.3.</hi> chapt. of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde Epiſtle, whiche neuertheleſſe referreth and applieth al thoſe his ſayinges to the ſame ſenſe that we haue touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For he ſayeth: ſeyng than that all theſe thinges ſhall be diſolued, what ought you to be in holy conuerſation, loking for and haſting the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng of the day of God? <hi>Aretas</hi> of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaria:</hi> the flight of heauen and earth, ſayeth he, ſignifieth no chaungyng of place, (for whither ſhould they flee?) but flight &amp; flittyng from corruption to incorruption, and the laſte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of the lord, vnder the which this mortal body of ours ſhal putte on immortalitie, and the face of the Earth ſhal be renewed. This ſayeth he, a like phraſe of ſpeach is had in the <hi>12.</hi> of the Apocalipſe, of the Angelles caſte downe out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: nother was their place founde any more in heauen, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Nowe toucheth he alſo who ſhall be iudged,<note place="margin">Who ſhall be iudged.</note> verely the dead. For he ſayeth: and I ſawe the dead. And ſhorteth after we ſhall heare, that the dead ſhal be reyſed vp. Therfore they ſhal be iudged that riſe from the dead. Neuertheles the liuing are not exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted, whome the Apoſtle ſayeth moſt manifeſtly ſhal be iudged in the <hi>.4.</hi> of the firſt to he <hi>Theſſ.</hi> But theſe he nameth not at this preſent, the dead he nameth: for that the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead is more hardely beleued: &amp; more eaſely beleued, that thoſe which remayne in fleſh ſhould be iudged
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:154393:342"/> at that daye. And verely the ſoules neuer die, the bodies die. Therfore where it is ſayde here, that the dead ſhal be iudged, we meane that al thoſe, which are dead at that daie ſhal come in their owne bodies to the iudgement of Chriſt. And al men muſt be iudged.<note place="margin">All me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are iudged.</note> Wherefore S. Iohn ſeeth great and ſmalle: that is to witte, men of all ſortes, ſtate, ſexe and age. Kinges and princes are not excepted, the common people ſhall not eſcape, nother children, nor olde folkes, men nor wemen. All theſe ſeeth he ſtandyng before the face, or iudgement ſeate of God. The gilty or accuſed, or to be accuſed ſhal be ſet before the iudgemente ſeate of God. And S. Paule alſo teſtifiyng expreſſely of this matter: we muſt al, ſayeth he, appere before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſte, that euery one maye receaue in his body, accordyng to that he hath done, whether it be good or euil <hi>.2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.</hi> chapt. but after a diuerſe maner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere both good &amp; euill. For the wicked as giltie are brought to be iudged and punniſhed, and that their giltines maye be openly knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to al creatures.<note place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly are iudged, not the godly.</note> The good, for aſmuch as they be iuſtified and quitte, &amp; haue nowe no more gilte nor crime by reaſon of Chriſtes ſatiſfaction, appere in iudgement with glory, ready to iudge the vngodly after their faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and not to be iudged of any. And this thinge is ſingular that, he ſayeth, that we ſhall be iudged in the ſighte of God. For who can appere in the ſight of the tremblable God, and fire conſumyng all thinges, ſaue he that is purged with the bloud of Chriſte? and what ſhall we thinke can be hidde or eſcape the ſight of God, ſeyng all thinges?</p>

                  <note place="margin">How men ſhall be iudged in the laſte iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note>S. Iohn moreouer declareth, howe the dead ſhoulde be iudged: bokes, ſayeth he, are opened: and an other booke is opened, &amp;c. Therefore by the bokes, after by the boke of life: that is to ſaye, of ſuch thinges as are written in thoſe bokes, the dead are iudged. For the Scripture aſcribeth vnto God the maner of men, wherby men are wonte to write for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues remembraunces, leeſt they ſhould forget thinges: but with God al things are ones and alwayes preſent, he nother forgetteth,<note place="margin">The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettyng &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bryng of God.</note> nor remembreth: not withſtanding the Scripture attributeth to him both.

In <hi>Malachie</hi>
                  <pb n="625" facs="tcp:154393:342"/> the vngodly ſaye, howe God hath no care of mens matters, nother doeth he for the godly, nor yet pu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niſheth the wicked. But immediately au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwere is made: than thei that feared the lord ſpake euery one to his neighbour: the lord gaue eare and hearde &amp; a boke of remembraunce was made in his preſence, &amp;c. As followeth. Therfore their bokes opened, that is to ſay, the ſecrettes of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought to light, or made manifeſt, the lord ſhal iudge what ſo euer hath ben thought, ſaide, done, or lefte vndone. The bokes alſo of conſciences (for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience is in ſtead of a thouſande witneſſes) ſhal be opened in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God reuealyng and iudging al thinges. For <hi>S.

And theſe are in dede the bookes whiche ſhall be vncloſed in the iudgement. Whereof it appereth, that the iudgement ſhal be done with moſt expedition, nother ſhall euery man be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all, by bookes written to make the iudge wery, as the ignoraunt might imagine hereby.</p>
               <p>But what is that ſingular boke of life,<note place="margin">The boke of life.</note> which alſo ſhalbe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boke of life is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the <hi>.3.</hi> cha. There you may ſee. To be brefe, the boke of life hath but one article: he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beleueth in the ſonne of god hath life euerlaſting.

A tree hath a growing or increaſing life which in latin is called, <hi>Anima vegetatiua,</hi> &amp; a nature or diſpoſition, bringyng forth fruicte after his nature &amp; kinde.

Therfore after our workes we ſhal be iudged al. For the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt be open &amp; manifeſt: but faith appereth not, but in workes. For it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gifte of God, &amp; is of it ſelfe inuiſible, to witte a ſure truſte in the promeſſes of God. And it is ſene in workes. Howbeit therof it followeth not, that men ar iuſtified by workes alſo, &amp; not by faith only: but that by workes faith is declared, which purifieth &amp; iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that afterwarde we may be able to bring forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workes of rightuouſenes.

               <p>For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently now <hi>S.

After he will declare more at large and ſeuerally all thoſe thinges moſte dilligently. For he heareth an Angel ſayeng: come I wil ſhewe thee the bryde the wife of the lambe, &amp;c. The ſame now figuratiuely he nameth a citie, &amp; that in dede holy, &amp; new
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:154393:346"/> Hieruſalem. And a citie ſignifieth aſwel the place &amp; habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as them that dwelle in the place, I meane the citezens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. This citie therfore is not only the place of the bleſſed, but alſo the very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of ſainctes, in olde time prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the citie of Hieruſalem.

Ours is alſo called newe. For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Sainctes ſhal be renewed at the ſame daye.

As alſo <hi>S. Iames</hi> is red to haue ſayde, euery good gifte and euery perfit gifte is from aboue, commyng downe from the father of lightes. And S. Paule alſo in the <hi>.4.</hi> to the <hi>Galath.</hi> ſayde that the free church is the heauenly Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The ſame in the <hi>.1. <hi>Corinth.</hi>

And as we haue borne the Image of the earthly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo ſhal we beare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Image of the heauenly. Therfore ſayed S.

For againe by a demonſtration: prepared of God, ſayeth he, as a bryde garniſhed for her huſbande. For the Apoſtle in the <hi>.2.</hi> to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> the <hi>.5.</hi> We know, ſayeth he, that yf our earthly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this tabernacle be deſtroied, we haue bildyng of god, a manſion not made with hande, euerlaſtyng in heauen.

Wherefore this garniſſhynge conſiſteth in the aboliſhinge of all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mortalitie, and in the gifte of vncorruption, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie,
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:154393:346"/> and glory. Of the purefying and deckyng of the bryde ſpeaketh the Apoſtle S.

For than ſhal the church haue nother ſpotte nor wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, al corruption verely wiped awaie, and al glory receyued. And here learne by the waye, that the Sainctes are prepared of God: therefore ſaluation to be of mere grace.</p>
               <p>And he procedeth to declare yet more playnely,<note place="margin">What ſhal be the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> what the glory ſhal be: whereof in this worke he hath ben occaſioned to ſpeake oftener than ones.

For God will geue vnto his Sainctes all that good is, and wil take from them al euill: and ſo ſhal theſe for euer inioye the ſouerayne good, and felicitie moſt perfit, and ſhal waunte al payne and miſerie.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">God will deliuer the Sainctes from all payne.</note>And than, like as God in himſelf geueth to the glorified al goodnes, ſo wil he remoue al euil from the ſame: ſo that they be not only deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> calamities, but the ſame ſhal neuer retourne, nor be feared more. The whiche in moſte plentifull wiſe he declareth, by wordes borrowed out of the oracles of the prophetes. God ſhal wipe awaye, ſayeth he, al teares fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their eyes.

                  </hi> They that ſowe in teares, ſayeth he, ſhall reape in gladnes. He ſemeth to haue alluded to moothers, which wipe the eyes of their tender and dere childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> criyng, comforte the ſorrowfull, and cheriſhe them hurte or bruiſſed. Therfore if the Sainctes haue ſuffered any payne or grefe in this world, when they ſhal come into an other world, it ſhal be requited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and prouided, that they ſhal fele no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie.

               </p>
               <p>Conſequently he declareth yet more fully by nombryng of the calamities, that the ſainctes in an other life ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered at ones from al euill: and death ſhal be no more. For they ſhal be rewarded with life euerlaſtyng. Therefore ſhall there be no more feare of death, whiche is in a maner more bitter than death it ſelfe.

For the Lord talketh with vs and euen liſpeth, to the ende we might after the imbecillitie of our witte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue theſe thinges. Yf any ſhuld wiſſhe for earthly things, I wene he could couet no greater thinges, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be here deſcribed. We ſhall thinke therefore, if the Lorde coulde geue theſe earthly thinges, yf he woulde, whie can he not geue greater to the ſoules of the godly and bodies glorified? yea the Lorde will that beyng withdrawen from the contemplation of earthly thinges, we ſhoulde loke altogether for celeſtiall and diuine, worthie of bleſſed ſoules and bodies clarified. Whiche vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly howe greate, and what they ſhall be, no tunge of manne can expreſſe to vs, be it neuer ſo eloquente. For the Lord hath prepared greater thinges for his ſeruauntes, than here we can comprehende. Therefore he bringeth forth here matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> moſte ample, that after a certen maner we mightie conceaue heauenly thinges muche more excellent than they be. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſenſe and meanyng of all thoſe thinges, whiche are ſpoken here of the riuer of life, and wood of life, by an ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication right excellent, is none other, but that the bleſſed in the heauenly countrie ſhall be quickened of God, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in that happie life with highe delectation for euermore. And there is no doubte, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> S. Iohn hath borrowed theſe thinges, as he doeth all the reſte, (ſins he is the expoſitour of the Prophetes) out of the Scriptures. And therefore hath he alluded to Paradiſe, whoſe deſcription ſet forth in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> doeth with this deſcription of Heauen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well agree. For there ſpringeth alſo a riuer in Paradiſe, whiche immediately is diuided into foure heades and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the garden of pleaſure moſte pleaſauntly.<note place="margin">The very paradiſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull is heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe.</note> In the ſame Paradiſe is the wood, that is the tree of life, bryngyng forth liuely fruicte to the eaters: as it is expounded of S.

<pb n="667" facs="tcp:154393:363"/> and Chriſte is come, to the ende he mighte brynge vs agayne into Paradiſe, that is to ſaye into high felicitie. Now therefore that trewe paradiſe, prepared for vs of Chriſte, is ſhewed in heauen, and is here deſcribed, into this Paradiſe entred the Lorde after death, and brought with him into the ſame alſo the faythfull thiefe, to whome he ſayed: verely I ſaye vnto thee, this daye ſhalte thou be with me in paradiſe. Therefore ought we not here to forge to our ſelues the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of <hi>Aleinous</hi> in Earth, or in the ayre aboue the globe of the Mone, and reaſon of Paradiſe terreſtriall. Our Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe is celeſtiall, whiche is prepared for vs in heauen: as S. Paule hath ſayde in the thirde to the <hi>Philipp.</hi> And Paradiſe is called a garden of pleaſure, as at this preſente it is called a golden Citie or of preciouſe ſtones, verely by a trope on ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide. Hereunto apperteyneth alſo a place of <hi>Zacharie</hi> in the <hi>.14.</hi> chapter. There is alſo an other place of Scripture in the <hi>.47.</hi> chapt. of <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> Whiche is this, and tranſlated or written out by S. Iohn into this place in a maner worde for worde: by the riuer ſayeth he, on eyther ſide of it ſhall growe vp all maner trees that beare fruicte, whoſe leaues ſhall not falle, nor the fruictes fayle, but euery moneth ſhal they bring forth newe fruictes. For their waters flowe out of the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie, and their fruictes ſhal be meate, and their leaues me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable. And <hi>Ezechiel</hi> vnder a figure ſeeth that ſame bleſſed life, and happie ſeates, whiche S. Iohn at this preſent ſeeth, by the ſhewyng of the Angell. And eyther of them both ſeeth the happie ſeates after the ſame ſorte, &amp; vnder the like figure. For there is one only bleſſednes, common to al the faythfull of the whole world. The Patriarches, Prophetes, Apoſtles, and Martirs atchieue all one felicitie. They ſee the Riuer on eyther ſide, and the ſame runnyng out of the Sanctuarie, or ſeate of God. They ſee on eyther ſide the riuer, trees planted that bryng forth the fruictes of life. They bring forth fruictes euery moneth freſſhe and newe: and the leaues of eyther do heale. I ſuppoſe the olde Poetes borrowed out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſuche thinges as they wrote in verſes concerning <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſia</hi> and <hi>Nectar,</hi> the meate and drinke of the Goddes.<note place="margin">the meates &amp; drinkes of goddes.</note> That ſhorte verſe of <hi>Martiall</hi> is knowen.</p>

He addeth a parable, whiche geueth light to that he hath ſayde, and ſayeth, cleare as a chriſtal. After he addeth, that this riuer is the riuer of the water of life, to witte liuely water, which preſerueth the drinkers therof in life. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he ſheweth alſo the originall or ſpringe head of this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, deriuyng the ſame from the ſeate of God, of the whiche ſeate or Trone I haue ſpoken in the <hi>.4.</hi> and <hi>.5.</hi> chapter of this booke.

For like as in his goſpel, in token of loyaltie he ſayeth: &amp; we know that his teſtimony is true: ſo in this place alſo, ſetting to his ſeale, he ſayeth, theſe ſayinges are faithful and trewe.

The which hath a great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacitie, for he ſheweth him not only to be one &amp; the ſame god of both Teſtamentes, whiche by his ſpirite hath inſpired the prophetes &amp; Apoſtles: but alſo biddeth vs ſecretly to eſteme the veritie &amp; certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie of this boke of the prophetical matters. For if he coulde in olde time telle his people before of things to come, &amp; vtter al thinges by the prophetes, what maruell is it, yf he nowe alſo perfourme the ſame by S. Iohn? And if all thoſe thinges came to paſſe, which the prophetes did prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to come, nother did there any word, no nor one iote fal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the grounde, which was not fulfilled: there is no man alſo that wil doubt of the veritie of this boke, yf at leeſt he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that the ſame God which in times paſt was w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prophets,

Wherefore all thinges are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly referred to Chriſt which ſent the Angell. But to whom ded he ſhew or reueale theſe thinges? To his ſeruaunts.

A like place in a maner is in the <hi>.2.</hi> chapt. of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> where we reade that the Lorde ſayde to the Prophet: thou ſonne of man, I ſende thee to the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iſrael, to a people rebelliouſe, which haue rebelled agaynſt me, they and their fathers haue dealte traytorouſly with me vntil this daye.

For in the Goſpel he ſayed: watch, for you know nother the daye nor the houre. Your Lord will come at an houre, when you thinke leeſt.

Notwithſtanding that by the ſpirite may be vnderſtand euery ſpirituall man alſo.

Howe be it with a wonderfull deſyre all the godly couet that the Lorde wolde come vnto iudgement: To the wicked that daye is terrible &amp; abhorred, to the godly moſte ioyfull and wyſſhed for. For the godly perceaue that they ſhall ones be deliuered from all euylles, and plentifully rewarded with all good thynges, that the glory and veritie of God ſhall be auaunced and eſtabliſhed, that all vngodly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſhall be aboliſhed, and the wicked by the iuſt iudgement of God tormented. Wherupon <hi>S. Peter</hi> in the .3. chapt. of the <hi>Actes,</hi> calleth this day the reſtoring &amp; perfourming of all ſuch things as God hath at any time ſpoken by the mouth of his Prophets. In that ſame day therfore ſhall all the promeſſes of God euen of the greateſte matters, be fulfilled througely. Therfore ſayeth the Lord in the goſpell: lifte vp your heads, for your redemption draweth nere. They that mourne and are deſperate like, caſt downe their heads: The Lord biddeth vs lifte vp our heades, to be cherefull and of good hope.

For the wicked for anguyſhe and payne and vtter deſperation ſhall crye oute, and teare themſelues: The godly ſhall reioyce in him, whome they ſee comming, ſhewynge the woundes wherewith they are redemed. Lyke as therefore the deſyre of Sainctes was greateſte, when the firſt commyng of our ſauiour approched nere, as in <hi>Symeon</hi> alone appeareth, <hi>Luke the ſecond,</hi> right ſo at the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſte vnto iudgement, all Saincts with vnceſſable
